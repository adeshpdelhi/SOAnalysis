How can I Java webstart multiple, dependent, native libraries? : Example: I have two shared objects (same should apply to .dlls). The first shared object is from a third-party library, we'll call it libA.so. I have wrapped some of this with JNI and created my own library, libB.so. Now libB depends on libA.When webstarting, both libraries are places in some webstart working area. My java code attempts to load libB. At this point the system loader will attempt to load libA which is not in the system library path (java.library.path won't help this). The end result is that libB has an unsatisfied link and cannot be used. I have tried loading libA before libB, but that still does not work. Seems the OS wants to do that loading for me. Is there any way I can make this work other than statically  compiling?
Java Logging vs Log4J : Is it still worth to add the log4j library to a Java 5 project just to loglet's say some exceptions to a file with some nice rollover settings.Or will the standard util.logging facility do the job as well?What do you think?
mtom serving word doc : has anyone been able to serve a word doc using metro (webservices) as a mtom stream? Does anyone have example, or know where there is example code please for client and server?
How do I create a thread dump of a Java Web Start application : Is it possible to get a thread dump of a Java Web Start application? And if so, how?It would be nice if there were a simple solution, which would enable a non-developer (customer) to create a thread dump. Alternatively, is it possible to create a thread dump programmatically?In the Java Web Start Console I can get a list of threads by pressing 't' but stacktraces are not included.If answers require certain java versions, please say so.

Turn an array of pixels into an Image object with Java's ImageIO? : I'm currently turning an array of pixel values (originally created with a java.awt.image.PixelGrabber object) into an Image object using the following code:public Image getImageFromArray(int[] pixels, int width, int height) {    MemoryImageSource mis = new MemoryImageSource(width, height, pixels, 0, width);    Toolkit tk = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit();    return tk.createImage(mis);}Is it possible to achieve the same result using classes from the ImageIO package(s) so I don't have to use the AWT Toolkit?Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit() does not seem to be 100% reliable and will sometimes throw an AWTError, whereas the ImageIO classes should always be available, which is why I'm interested in changing my method.
Objections against Java Webstart? : Since the release of Adobe AIR I am wondering why Java Web Start has not gained more attention in the past as to me it seems to be very similar, but web start is available for a much longer time.Is it mainly because of bad marketing from Sun, or are there more technical concerns other than the need of having the right JVM installed? Do you have bad experiences using Web Start? If yes, which? What are you recommendations when using Web Start for distributing applications?

Can i update a signed jar using an ANT Task? : Hi I am trying to deploy an application using webstart. I have a requirement to update a  jar which is signed before i actually deploy( basically to update the IP/Port info). I am trying to use ANT to update the jar. Is there are way to achive this?
Loading animated gif from JAR file into ImageIcon : I'm trying to create a ImageIcon from a animated gif stored in a jar file.ImageIcon imageIcon = new ImageIcon(ImageIO.read(MyClass.class.getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(animated.gif)));The image loads, but only the first frame of the animated gif.  The animation does not play. If I load the animated gif from a file on the filesystem, everything works as expected.  The animation plays through all the of frames.  So this works:ImageIcon imageIcon = new ImageIcon(/path/on/filesystem/animated.gif);How can I load an animated gif into an ImageIcon from a jar file?EDIT:   Here is a complete test case, why doesn't this display the animation?import javax.imageio.ImageIO;import javax.swing.*;public class AnimationTest extends JFrame {    public static void main(String[] args) {        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {            public void run() {                AnimationTest test = new AnimationTest();                test.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);                test.setVisible(true);            }        });    }    public AnimationTest() {        super();        try {            JLabel label = new JLabel();            ImageIcon imageIcon = new ImageIcon(ImageIO.read(AnimationTest.class.getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(animated.gif)));            label.setIcon(imageIcon);            imageIcon.setImageObserver(label);            add(label);            pack();        } catch (Exception e) {            e.printStackTrace();        }    }}
Emulating user input for java.util.Scanner : I'm writing a game in Java, and I want the user to be able to provide input from both the command line and my GUI. Currently, I use this method to get input:    static String getInput(){        System.out.println(Your move:);        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);        return sc.nextLine();    }I want to keep using this, but let a mousePressed event emulate the user actually typing in their input as well.  It's not that efficient of a solution, but it makes sense in my application. So the question is: how do I simulate a user typing to System.in from the code side?
Do I have to explicitly call System.exit() in a Webstart application? : Recently I converted a Swing application to Webstart. The process was pretty straightforward, but I found that after I close all windows, my application's JVM did not terminate. The thread dump showed that there are a couple of non-daemon threads, notably Swing's EDT, AWT and a couple of websart related threads. The actual strategy used is that each window increments a counter when it is created and decrements one when it is closed. The default close operation is DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE. Wen the counter reaches zero, I stop all threadpools and release all JNI resources.When I launched the application from a bat file (same JARs), it terminated fine when all windows were closed, so I figured that the problem has something to do with Webstart.Now the questions:Can anybody tell me what exactly is happening? Why does Webstart leave zombie JVMs? Is there a way to release the Webstart resources explicitly without halting the JVM? I've always had the opinion that calling System.exit() encourages the sloppy practice of not releasing your resources and relying on the OS to clean up after you (which can lead to nasty surprises if you reuse the code later)... am I missing something?See also the a href=http://stackoverflow.com/questions/216315/what-is-the-best-way-to-detect-whether-an-application-is-launched-by-webstartfollowup question for detecting whether the app has been launched by Webstart.
Which annotation should I use: @IdClass or @EmbeddedId : The JPA (Java Persistence API) specification has 2 different ways to specify entity composite keys: @IdClass and @EmbeddedId. I'm using both annotations on my mapped entities, but it turns out to be a big mess to people who aren't very familiar with JPA. I want to adopt only one way to specify composite keys. Which one is really the best? Why?
What is the best way to detect whether an application is launched by Webstart : As it was made clear in my a href=http://stackoverflow.com/questions/212009/do-i-have-to-explicitly-call-systemexit-in-a-webstart-applicationrecent question, Swing applications need to explicitly call System.exit() when they are ran using the Sun Webstart launcher (at least as of Java SE 6).I want to restrict this hack as much as possible and I am looking for a reliable way to detect whether the application is running under Webstart. Right now I am checking that the value of the system property webstart.version is not null, but I couldn't find any guarantees in the documentation that this property should be set by future versions/alternative implementations.Are there any better ways (preferably ones that do not ceate a dependency on the the webstart API?)
Write dpi metadata to a jpeg image in Java : I am trying to programatically set the dpi metadata of an jpeg image in Java. The source of the image is a scanner, so I get the horizontal/vertical resolution from TWAIN, along with the image raw data. I'd like to save this info for better print results.Here's the code I have so far. It saves the raw image (byteArray) to a JPEG file, but it ignores the X/Ydensity information I specify via IIOMetadata. Any advice what I'm doing wrong? Any other solution (third-party library, etc) would be welcome too. import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;import java.awt.image.WritableRaster;import java.io.File;import javax.imageio.IIOImage;import javax.imageio.ImageIO;import javax.imageio.ImageTypeSpecifier;import javax.imageio.metadata.IIOMetadata;import javax.imageio.plugins.jpeg.JPEGImageWriteParam;import javax.imageio.stream.ImageOutputStream    import org.w3c.dom.Element;    import com.sun.imageio.plugins.jpeg.JPEGImageWriter;public boolean saveJpeg(int[] byteArray, int width, int height, int dpi, String file){    BufferedImage bufferedImage = new BufferedImage(width, height, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB);    WritableRaster wr = bufferedImage.getRaster();    wr.setPixels(0, 0, width, height, byteArray);    try    {                   // Image writer         JPEGImageWriter imageWriter = (JPEGImageWriter) ImageIO.getImageWritersBySuffix(jpeg).next();        ImageOutputStream ios = ImageIO.createImageOutputStream(new File(file));        imageWriter.setOutput(ios);        // Compression        JPEGImageWriteParam jpegParams = (JPEGImageWriteParam) imageWriter.getDefaultWriteParam();        jpegParams.setCompressionMode(JPEGImageWriteParam.MODE_EXPLICIT);        jpegParams.setCompressionQuality(0.85f);        // Metadata (dpi)        IIOMetadata data = imageWriter.getDefaultImageMetadata(new ImageTypeSpecifier(bufferedImage), jpegParams);        Element tree = (Element)data.getAsTree(javax_imageio_jpeg_image_1.0);        Element jfif = (Element)tree.getElementsByTagName(app0JFIF).item(0);        jfif.setAttribute(Xdensity, Integer.toString(dpi));        jfif.setAttribute(Ydensity, Integer.toString(dpi));        jfif.setAttribute(resUnits, 1); // density is dots per inch                 // Write and clean up        imageWriter.write(data, new IIOImage(bufferedImage, null, null), jpegParams);        ios.close();        imageWriter.dispose();    }    catch (Exception e)    {       return false;    }    return true;}Thanks!
How many Web service objects are created in JAX-WS RI? : When I annotate a Java class with @WebService and use it with JAX-WS RI (Metro), how many objects of my class does the JAX-WS RI create?

For time being I use a self signed certificate to the sign the jars (by default created using Sun's jarsigner, keytool, etc, utils).Solution/steps would be much appreciated.Thanks in advanceRamesh
How do I use JDK6 ToolProvider and JavaCompiler with the context classloader? : My usage case is compiling generated source files from a java program using the ToolProvider and JavaCompiler classes provided in JDK 6.  The source files contain references to classes in the context classloader (it runs in a J2EE container), but not in the system classloader. My understanding is that by default the ToolProvider will create the JavaCompiler instance with the system classloader.Is there a way to specify a classloader for JavaCompiler to use?I tried this approach, modified from something on IBM DeveloperWorks:FileManagerImpl fm =     new FileManagerImpl(compiler.getStandardFileManager(null, null, null););with FileManagerImpl defined as:static final class FileManagerImpl     extends ForwardingJavaFileManagerJavaFileManager {   public FileManagerImpl(JavaFileManager fileManager) {      super(fileManager);   }   @Override   public ClassLoader getClassLoader(JavaFileManager.Location location) {      new Exception().printStackTrace();      return Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();   }}The stacktrace indicates it's only called once during annotation processing.  I verified the class referenced in the source file to be compiled is not on the system classpath but is available from the context classloader.

How to add a driver to javax.comm? Serial port programming in Java : I am trying to use a RS-232 serial port on my PC with javax.comm class. I am newby on that API, so first of all I go through the documentation and I find out that the first thing you should do is list all the ports from the class CommPortListener and pick up one of them.That worked just fine! Problem is, now, that my port is missing. It lists the /dev/ttyS0 and /dev/ttyS1 ports, non existents on my computer. My ports (I have been working with them several times) are /dev/ttySNX0 and /dev/ttySNX1.Again surfing the web I find out that I should do something like register or load the driver of my card onto the API system, stuff that could be done in previous versions, but not now. Moreover, I tried to do it under windows and they offer me a generic version of the API, with needs some RXTX application which is starting to beat me.I would thank any sugestions, links to documentation... something... that allow me to use my serial ports through Java, wich, in the end, is my objective...Thanks folks!!!!
Convert PNG to bitonal TIFF : -Edit-FYI..

In this time we have seen enterprise applications move from client server to thin clients.  We have also seen the move to hosted solutions, albeit under a few names (asp, SaaS, cloud computing).  With all these changes the impetuous has been mainly from driven from the IT department not the end user.  In the first rounds of these revolutions the user experience was reduced in the name of single point of management and reduced desktop footprint.  During this time there have been many attempts to give the user a rich experience while still satisfying the crotchety IT department.  The first was by the industry leader Microsoft in the form of the ActiveX control.  The guys from Sun then followed suit with the applet and then more recently java webstart.  All of these solutions seemed to scratch the itch but never gained wide expectance by the more stringent IT departments.Then flex came on the scene from Macromedia.  What did they do differently?  Is it sustainable?  Does Microsoft’s emulation with Silverlight prove they have changed the rules of the game?  Will Web programming be changed forever?
How to use ImageIO to save multiple BufferedImages to a file : I tried both of the following options:1.BufferedImage Buffered_Image;MemoryCacheImageOutputStream MemoryCache_OutputStream =      new MemoryCacheImageOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(C:/Test.mov,false));while (notFinished)  // Main recording loop.{   Buffered_Image=robot.createScreenCapture();         // Capture Screen image.   try { ImageIO.write(Buffered_Image,png,MemoryCache_OutputStream); }   catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }}2.BufferedImage Buffered_Image;ImageWriter writer;try{  ImageOutputStream ios=ImageIO.createImageOutputStream(new File(C:/Test.mov));  Iterator writers=ImageIO.getImageWritersByFormatName(png);  while (writers.hasNext())  {    writer=(ImageWriter)writers.next();    writer.setOutput(ios);    Out(writer.toString()+  canInsertImage : +writer.canInsertImage(0));    // Got this: com.sun.imageio.plugins.png.PNGImageWriter@19fcc69      // canInsertImage : false  }}catch (Exception e) { }cntPics=0;while (notFinished)  // Main recording loop.{   Buffered_Image=robot.createScreenCapture();         // Capture Screen image.   writer.write(null,new IIOImage(Buffered_Image,null,null),null);   if (writer.canInsertImage(-1)) {         // Append image at highest index         writer.writeInsert(-1,new IIOImage(Buffered_Image,null,null),null);    } else Out(Writer can’t append image Id : +cntPics);   cntPics++;}Neither of them worked, what's the correct way to save multiple PNG images to a file?Edit:You are right, I found a java program called a href=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=129468 rel=nofollow noreferrerKrut that can record screen sessions, but it uses JPEGImageEncoder, the image quality isn't as good as I want, so I wonder if I can use ImageIO to encode the sequence.If ImageIO can't do it, my next question would be is there a stand alone open source PNGImageEncoder that I can use to encode it? I know there are open source PNGImageEncoders, but they tend to be tangled in projects and hard to get all the supporting files out of it, any ideas? Thanks!
Can I import Java class files into JRuby? : The documentation seems to suggest that in order for me to import Java classes into JRuby, that they must be in a JAR file:In order to use resources within a jar file from JRuby the jar file must either be on the classpath or you can make it available with the require method(a href=http://wiki.jruby.org/wiki/Calling_Java_from_JRuby#Require_a_jar_file_to_make_resources_in_the_jar_discoverable_within_JRuby rel=nofollow noreferrerhttp://wiki.jruby.org/wiki/Calling_Java_from_JRuby#Require_a_jar_file_to_make_resources_in_the_jar_discoverable_within_JRuby)Is it at all possible to import .class files directly?Thanks!
jar resources in jnlp are not signed by the same certificate : I've been working with web start for a couple years now and have experience with signing the jars and what not. I am taking my first attempt at deploying a RCP app with web start and though I have in fact signed all of the jars with the same certificate I keep getting this error: 'jar resources in jnlp are not signed by the same certificate'Has anyone else came across this? If so, any ideas on how to fix?
Separating presentation/web-services : Is it a good practice to develop web-service and web-site in two different languages, on two different servers? E.g. right now I create a Java web-service running on Glassfish and Ruby on Rails presentation layer running in the same server.I'd like to leave web-service on the same server but use Ruby 1.9, running in Passenger.Is it a good idea? I don't have experience in architecture of web-apps.
How to mix java webstart with RMI? : I want to distribute a webstart application which uses RMI.I want to avoid to ask the user the address of the RMI server, because the website that distributes the application is also the RMI server.Furthermore, I don't know the address of the server at build time, therefore the address must be added with ad hoc configuration to the JNLP, or the address must be provided at execution time. This is the preferred way: is it possible to do so?
Easier way to guarantee integer input through Scanner? : For a program I am writing, I need to ask a user for an integer between 1 and 8. I've tried multiple (cleaner) ways of doing this but none of them worked, so I'm left with this:    int x = 0;    while (x  1 || x  8)    {           System.out.print(Please enter integer  (1-8): );        try        {            x = Integer.parseInt(inputScanner.next());        }        catch(NumberFormatException e)        {            x = 0;        }    }Where inputScanner is a  Scanner. Surely there is a better way?
Is there a way in scala to convert from any Map to java.util.Map? : I use a lot of scala maps, occasionally I want to pass them in as a map to a legacy java api which wants a java.util.Map (and I don't care if it throws away any changes).

Iterating over Java collections in Scala : I'm writing some Scala code which uses the a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_POI rel=nofollow noreferrerApache POI API. I would like to iterate over the rows contained in the java.util.Iterator that I get from the Sheet class. I would like to use the iterator in a for each style loop, so I have been trying to convert it to a native Scala collection but will no luck.I have looked at the Scala wrapper classes/traits, but I can not see how to use them correctly. How do I iterate over a Java collection in Scala without using the verbose while(hasNext()) getNext() style of loop?Here's the code I wrote based on the correct answer:class IteratorWrapper[A](iter:java.util.Iterator[A]){    def foreach(f: A = Unit): Unit = {        while(iter.hasNext){          f(iter.next)        }    }}object SpreadsheetParser extends Application{    implicit def iteratorToWrapper[T](iter:java.util.Iterator[T]):IteratorWrapper[T] = new IteratorWrapper[T](iter)    override def main(args:Array[String]):Unit =    {        val ios = new FileInputStream(assets/data.xls)        val workbook = new HSSFWorkbook(ios)        var sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0)        var rows = sheet.rowIterator()        for (val row - rows){            println(row)        }    }}
Real-time Java interoperability : I am wondering how it's the interoperability between JRE6 and the JVM from a href=http://www.rtsj.org rel=nofollow noreferrerrtsj. It seems that I have to use only their implementation (since the code will be interpreted using their JVM), so I cannot use many of the features that Java 6 has to offer.Can it support a GUI? (say for example to modify the parameters of an industrial process).I might be wrong, hoping to get some feedback from you.Also, it seems that are more real time implementations for Java. Which one did you use and which one did you like most?

implements Runnable vs. extends Thread : From what time I've spent with threads in Java, I've found these two ways to write threads:With implements Runnable:public class MyRunnable implements Runnable {    public void run() {        //Code    }}//Started with a new Thread(new MyRunnable()).start() callOr, with extends Thread:public class MyThread extends Thread {    public MyThread() {        super(MyThread);    }    public void run() {        //Code    }}//Started with a new MyThread().start() callIs there any significant difference in these two blocks of code ?
Real time thread synchronization with normal threads : How would one synchronize one real-time thread with a normal thread in Java? Take for example a real-time thread that calculates some temperatures and the GUI thread that has to collect those numbers and show them on some controls.The implementation of the real-time library shouldn't matter as it should follow the specifications.
Diagnosing and improving performance of a java jnlp compared to jar file : Customer X has asked for ways to improve the startup time of a Java process he uses. The problem is, it is not run through a jar file, but rather 'jnlp' (which I am assuming indicates it is a java webstart application)StartUserWorx.jnlpIs there a way to convert this to a JAR file and then have the user invoke the application locally, and include a startup flag to the JRE to allocate more ram to the process?The user is getting a bit frustrated, because other workers in the same office use the same application on almost identical machines, and yet his process seems to always take a much longer time to load (a few minutes rather than a few seconds).
How to prevent piracy for java webstart application : I have this java swing application that I intend to sell over the internet.  At the moment I'm leaning towards deploying the application using java webstart.  The product will be licensed for the user to use the program on one computer at a time only.  I am concerned about piracy with this model.  I would like to install some security features to enforce the license model.  The goal is to at least make it difficult for a licensed user to copy the installed product including license key to unlicensed users.  Here are the options I am looking at now:Force the user to authenticate to the mother ship with a username/password each time the program is launched.Simply install a license key somewhere (hidden?) on the users PC after they have registered and paid.  At runtime, verify that there is a valid license key installed.Use/build a security package that is based on a hardware fingerprint of the users computer.  This fingerprint would be computed each time the app is started and compared with the locally installed license key using some sort of hash.  This license key would be would only be valid with this hardware fingerprint.  One of the issues here is that once this application is installed, there isn't any runtime need for the application to contact the mother ship, other than checking for application updates using java webstart.  Everything the app does it does locally and displays the results to the user using swing.  So any solution involving a mother ship would basically mean building a server infrastructure for the sole purpose of license verification.I guess what I'm looking for is something java based that is at least somewhat secure, easy to deploy and is not a pain for the user.  What security/licensing approach have you used?EDIT: I should add that I am not necessarily looking for a silver bullet to prevent absolutely everyone from defeating security.  There will always be someone with enough time on their hands to find ways to get it done.  I'm not so concerned with these guys.  I'm basically looking to make it difficult for a casual user to simply copy the license key and send to his buddies.  Implemented correctly, the solution should convince the casual user that it is simpler to just buy it.
Java Web Start - Popularity : I recently used a Java Web Start application. I launched it from my web browser using an embedded jnlp link in the page I was viewing. The application was downloaded, launched and worked just fine. It had access to my local file-system and  remembered my preferences between restarting it.What I want to know is why are Java Web Start applications not a more popular delivery format for complex applications on the web? Why do developers often spend considerable time amp; energy replicating desktop functionality in html/javascript when the power of a desktop application could be delivered more easily using Java amp; Java Web Start?I know that in some corporate environments, e.g banking, they are relatively popular ways of delivering complex trading applications to clients, but why are they not pervasive across the web as a whole?(For the sake of discussion let's assume a world where: download sources are trusted amp; applications are signed (i.e. no security concerns),  download speeds are fast (load time is quick) and developers know Java (in the numbers they know html/js/php)).

Netbeans and .NET web services : I'm not an experienced java developer so any comment will be welcomed ...I've written a web service using c# and I wanted to consume this service from java - used Netbeans for this task.All methods works well beside one: the method expecting a type called BusinessDataField2 - this type contains 2 fields: name(string) and value(object)Those fields are filled using get,set methods - this works easily at the .NET environment.However ...I can see that Java requires different parameters for the get and set methods - the parameter is :JAXBElementJAXBElement The question is: how do I instantiate this object? I tried many different ways but nothing worked...Thanks,ofer
ImageIO.write not saving out as gif, but works for jpgs and pngs? : I suspect the solution here is probably really simple, but I'm stumped...// Create the buffered image.BufferedImage bufferedImage = new BufferedImage(w,h,BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB);// fill image data (works fine)ImageIO.write(bufferedImage, JPG, f1); // works fineImageIO.write(bufferedImage, PNG, f2); // works fineImageIO.write(bufferedImage, GIF, f3); // this returns false, creates a broken gif file, but fires no exceptionsDoes ImageIO.write() not work for gifs? is this some sort of throwback to gif being a proprietary Compuserve thing? Or am I just being stupid (I'm guessing it's the last one :) ) 
Confusion over class resolution in Oracle java stored procedures : I'm trying to use a third-party java library within oracle.  The library seems compatible with the same 1.4 version of the jvm that our Oracle 10g server hosts, since it runs fine outside of Oracle, so I feel like I should be able to get this to work.  This library ends up making SOAP-based http requests, and I get class resolution errors when I run in Oracle.Here's a line that shows the difference:Class msgfact = Class.forName(com.sun.xml.messaging.saaj.soap.MessageFactoryImpl);I tried to register these libraries into Oracle with the loadjava utility, and I got what I thought was a successful result:C:\loadjava -verbose -schema MYUSER -user MYUSER/MYPWD@dbinstance -force saaj-impl.jarIt looks like everything gets loaded, and I can see this MessageFactoryImpl class in that list.  But then I try to run this line of code from Oracle SQL (inside another class I wrote and loaded with loadjava), this line throws a ClassNotFoundException (java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/MessageFactoryImpl).Then I went back and tried to add the -resolve switch at the loadjava command line.  It acts like these saaj classes are getting registered, but they aren't resolving properly.  How can I successfully get these saaj classes into Oracle,  or if for some reason Oracle already has these loaded, how can I convince my own code to successfully use the existing class?FWIW, I already took the steps to make sure that the appropriate socket permissions were granted and my code can successfully make a generic http request to the target url.  It just has trouble using the library's SOAP stack to make it happen.EDIT:Here is a sample of my loadjava result.  This seems to be showing exactly what's failing, but I'm confused as to why these particular classes aren't being resolved when they seem to be handled properly in the pre-resolution steps.  I've eliminated about 80% of the file here, but there are other classes that show the same class resolution issues.arguments: '-verbose' '-schema' 'MYSCHEMA' '-user' 'MYSCHEMA/MYSCHEMA@actest' '-resolve' '-force' 'saaj-impl.jar' [snip]creating : class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/EnvelopeFactoryloading  : class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/EnvelopeFactorycreating : class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/GifDataContentHandlerloading  : class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/GifDataContentHandlercreating : class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/JpegDataContentHandlerloading  : class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/JpegDataContentHandlercreating : class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/MessageFactoryImplloading  : class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/MessageFactoryImplcreating : class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/MessageImplloading  : class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/MessageImpl[snip]resolving: class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/AttachmentPartImplresolving: class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/Enveloperesolving: class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/EnvelopeFactoryerrors   : class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/EnvelopeFactory    ORA-29534: referenced object MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/SOAPPartImpl could not be resolvedresolving: class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/GifDataContentHandlerresolving: class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/JpegDataContentHandlerresolving: class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/MessageFactoryImplerrors   : class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/MessageFactoryImpl    ORA-29534: referenced object MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/MessageImpl could not be resolvederrors   : class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/MessageImpl    ORA-29534: referenced object MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/impl/EnvelopeImpl could not be resolvederrors   : class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/MessageImpl$1    ORA-29534: referenced object MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/MessageImpl could not be resolvedskipping : class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/MessageImpl$2[snip]The following operations failed    class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/EnvelopeFactory: resolution    class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/MessageFactoryImpl: resolution    class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/MessageImpl: resolution    class MYSCHEMA.com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/MessageImpl$1: resolution[snip]exiting  : Failures occurred during processing
Java appears hung : I've been using the Java Service wrapper in a custom application for quite a while and it's been working fine. Since updating our application to a new version in the last few days the JVM started hanging and then wrapper prints this in the log: JVM appears hung: Timed out waiting for signal from JVM.It then automatically terminates the JVM and starts the app again. This happens after about 10 hours of running, which just makes it harder to debug.Of course I am going to look through the changes that we've made, but no major changes were made that I would suspect is causing this type of problem.Where can I look to try and figure out what is happening? Debug messages from the application don't indicate anything interesting. If the JVM just crashes it will usually create a dump, which can help in debugging it, but it's hanging, so it's not creating a dump. If I make it not restart the service automatically is there anything I can do to get some useful information out of the JVM before restarting it?It seems to me that the JVM shouldn't hang from typical programming errors. What have you run into before that can cause the JVM to hang?
Can a signed Jar be run as an executable? : I ask because I have an unsigned jar that runs and a signed version that doesn't. Looking at the manifests, I see no main class thing for the signed one.  Do I have to run a signed jar from web start?

Consuming .NET webservice in Java (metro) - XMLNode/XMLDocument consumption? : I am a bit rusty in my Java, and this is my first time using metro/JAX-WS, so if this is a dumb question I apologize.I have to write a client that consumes a .NET webservice.  I've got the basics down; I have generated the wrappers from the WSDL, and I can create my object and port and make a call and get a response.    Widgets d = new Widgets();    WidgetsSoap dp = d.getWidgetsSoap();    ((BindingProvider)dp).getRequestContext(). put(javax.xml.ws.BindingProvider.ENDPOINT_ADDRESS_PROPERTY, http://actualsite/foo.asmx);    UserGetWidgetsResponse.UserGetWidgetsResult j = dp.userGetWidgets();The webservice's return values are almost all XmlDocument or XmlNode.  How do I get from the wsimport-generated UserGetWidgetsResponse.UserGetWidgetsResult to the actual XML returned by the call?  I have a number of these services with a bunch of methods, so I'm hoping to find a solution that does not require modifying the generated wrappers in any way.  I also do not have control over the information returned by the web services.
How do I pipe the Java console output to a file? : I found a bug in an application that completely freezes the JVM. The produced stacktrace would provide valuable information for the developers and I would like to retrieve it from the Java console. When the JVM crashes, the console is frozen and I cannot copy the contained text anymore.Is there way to pipe the Java console directly to a file or some other means of accessing the console output of a Java application?Update: I forgot to mention, without changing the code. I am a manual tester.Update 2: This is under Windows XP and it's actually a web start application. Piping the output of javaws jnlp-url does not work (empty file).

Dynamically load additional jar files using Web Start / JNLP : The a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/javaws/developersguide/development.html#retrieving rel=nofollow noreferrerWeb Start Developers Guide statesblockquote  All application resources must be retrieved from the JAR files specified    in the resources section of the JNLP file, or retrieved explicitly    using an HTTP request to the Web server.     Storing resources in JAR files is recommended, since they will be cached    on the local machine by Java Web Start./blockquoteNow, I have some resources I want to dynamically load after my application has been started (for example OSGi bundles). I can do this using plain HTTP, but I would like to make use of Web Start's support for local caching and versioned/architecture-specific resources.Is there a way to download additional jar files from the original code base (as specified in the application's jnlp file) using the Web Start infrastructure?Or alternatively: is there already an established way to integrate OSGi and Web Start that would relieve me of the task to install bundles from the Web Start server?

Scanner vs. StringTokenizer vs. String.Split : I just learned about Java's Scanner class and now I'm wondering how it compares/competes with the StringTokenizer and String.Split.

Lock a file while writing it on the disk : I have two independant threads F1 and F2 (to be precise, two instances of java.util.concurrent.FutureTask) that are running in parallel.F1 do some processing, and then copy the result in a XML file. Then, it repeats these steps until it has nothing to do (many XML files are created).F2 looks in the F1 output directory, and take one file, parse it, and execute some processing on it.This works quite pretty well, except that sometimes, F2 gets truncated XML data from the file. I mean by that an incomplete XML, where some XML node are not present. The problem is that it is not always reproductible, and the files that are truncated are not always the same.Because of that, I am thinking that while F1 is writing one file on the disk, F2 is trying to read the same file. That's why sometimes I get this kind of error.My question: I am wondering if there is some mechanism that locks (even for reading) the file F1 is currently writing until it has completely finished to write it on the disk, so F2 will not be able to read it until the file is unlocked. Or any other way to solve my issue will be welcome !F1 is writing the file this way:try {    file = new File(some-file.xml);    FileUtils.writeStringToFile(file, xmlDataAsString);} catch (IOException ioe) {    LOGGER.error(Error occurred while storing the XML in a file., ioe);}F2 is reading the file this way:private File getNextFileToMap() {    File path = getPath(); // Returns the directory where F1 stores the results...    File[] files = path.listFiles(new FilenameFilter() {        public boolean accept(File file, String name) {            return name.toLowerCase().endsWith(.xml);        }    });    if (files.length  0) {        return files[0];    }    return null;}// Somewhere in my main method of F2...f = getNextFileToMap();Node xmlNode = null;try {    DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();    DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();    Document doc = builder.parse(f);    if (doc != null) {        xmlNode = doc.getDocumentElement();    }} catch (Exception e) {    LOGGER.error(Error while getting the XML from the file  + f.getAbsolutePath(), e);}
JAX-WS Consuming web service with WS-Security and WS-Addressing : I'm trying to develop a standalone Java web service client with JAX-WS (Metro) that uses WS-Security with Username Token Authentication (Password digest, nonces and timestamp) and timestamp verification along with WS-Addressing over SSL. The WSDL I have to work with does not define any security policy information. I have been unable to figure out exactly how to add this header information (the correct way to do so) when the WSDL does not contain this information.  Most examples I have found using Metro revolve around using Netbeans to automatically generate this from the WSDL which does not help me at all.  I have looked into WSIT, XWSS, etc. without much clarity or direction.  JBoss WS Metro looked promising not much luck yet there either.Anyone have experience doing this or have suggestions on how to accomplish this task? Even pointing me in the right direction would be helpful.  I am not restricted to a specific technology other than it must be Java based.  
Writing a cleaner and more modular command-parser : I'm writing a debugger for a Z80-emulator we are writing in a school project, using Java. The debugger reads a command from the user, executes it, reads another command, etc. Commands can either be argument less, have optional arguments, or take an unlimited amount of arguments. Arguments are mostly integers, but occasionally they're strings.Currently, we're using the Scanner-class for reading and parsing input. a href=http://pastebin.com/m2a062299 rel=nofollow noreferrerThe read-method looks kinda like like this (I'm writing this off the top of my head, not paying attention to syntax nor correctness).This was a kludge written in the beginning of the project, which quickly got out of hand as we added more and more commands to the debugger.The major issues I have with this code is the large amount of repetition, the highlevel of if/else-nestedness, and the all around uglyness.I would like suggestions on how to make this code more beautiful and modular, and what kind of patterns that are suitable for this kind of program. I would also like more general suggestions on code style. 
How can I save a PNG with a tEXt or iTXt chunk from Java? : I am currently using javax.imageio.ImageIO to write a PNG file. I would like to include a tEXt chunk (and indeed any of the chunks a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics#Ancillary_chunks rel=nofollow noreferrerlisted here), but can see no means of doing so.By the looks of com.sun.imageio.plugins.png.PNGMetadata it should be possible.I should be most grateful for any clues or answers.M.
Is there an equivalent to the Scanner class in C# for strings? : In Java I can pass a Scanner a string and then I can do handy things like, scanner.hasNext() or scanner.nextInt(), scanner.nextDouble() etc.This allows some pretty clean code for parsing a string that contains rows of numbers.How is this done in C# land?If you had a string that say had:0 0 1 22 39 0 0 1 2 33 33In Java I would pass that to a scanner and do a while(scanner.hasNext())     myArray[i++] = scanner.nextInt();Or something very similar.  What is the C#' ish way to do this?
How to obtain a Java stack trace from a client running under web start? : I wanted to get ideas from the SO community about this issue.Here is the problem:We have a user on the other side of the world launching our app through WebStart. The user, however, is complaining that her whole application freezes up and becomes unresponsive. Usually, the client is doing a lot of database queries to a distributed database.Questions:If we ask her to do a CTRL-Break on her application, where would the JVM write the stack trace to?Would it be enough just to use JConsole?Would implementing JMX beans on the client be overkill? Would it actually help in troubleshooting issues in production?Right now the users are running on JRE 1.5.0-b08, but we do plan on migrating to JRE 6 in a couple of months.What do you think?
What are some interesting uses for Java Agents? : Starting with Java 5 there's an option to add Java Agents to the class loader.Have you written any Agents?have you used any Agents?What are interesting uses of Agents?
Mini-OSGi that can run in a sandbox (like AppEngine or WebStart)? : I really like the concept of modular bundles as implemented by OSGi.I also like managed deployment services like Google AppEngine (for web application) or Java WebStart (for client software).These two ideas seem to complement each-other rather well conceptually.However, the OSGi standard  includes a couple of features that make it impossible for implementations like Felix or Equinox to run on top of sandboxed virtual machines, such as AppEngine or Webstart. In these environments, it is not possible to get direct access to a file system, for example, which precludes the OSGi bundle cache that is used to store persistent bundle state and native libraries.Now, I have no great interest in using native libraries or have persistent bundle state. Is there some framework that implements the core bundle and services concept of OSGi (ideally in a compatible way so that OSGi bundles can be deployed into it as is), but can work without a bundle cache (and other facilities not available in a sandbox)?I am looking for something like a limited version of Felix that works on AppEngine or WebStart.Of course, if the WebStart engine and the Google AppEngine just provided OSGi framework services out-of-the-box that would be great, too...Update: Another very limiting aspect of AppEngine is that you cannot start new Threads. This prevents (among other things) asynchronous bundle life-cycle management. Obviously not an issue with WebStart.
Java's Scanner vs String.split() vs StringTokenizer; which should I use? : I am currently using split() to scan through a file where each line has number of strings delimited by '~'. I read somewhere that Scanner could do a better job with a long file, performance-wise, so I thought about checking it out. My question is: Would I have to create two instances of Scanner? That is, one to read a line and another one based on the line to get tokens for a delimiter? If I have to do so, I doubt if I would get any advantage from using it. Maybe I am missing something here?
Can I add classes to sun's rt.jar file? : I downloaded the Javax.mail package. I have jdk1.6.0_11.Problem is...I cannot get javac or java to find those classes!I can get apps to compile using JCreator LE ( by adding the mail jarto its search list ) but, when I try to run the app in a command window,it fails.Can I add these new classes to the rt.jar without hurting my jdk installation? I know java has it wired up to look there for classes.(And, the mail classes are inside a javax package - seems like they could reasonably be added to the javax folder in rt.jar..Thanks!Phil D'
use of delimiter function from scanner for abc-def : I'm currently trying to filter a text-file which contains words that are separated with a -. I want to count the words.scanner.useDelimiter(([.,:;()?!\ \t\n\r]+));The problem which occurs simply is: words that contain a - will get separated and counted for being two words. So just escaping with \- isn't the solution of choice.How can I change the delimiter-expression, so that words like foo-bar will stay, but the - alone will be filtered out and ignored?Thanks ;)
How to get java Logger output to file by default : Netbeans thoughtfully sprinkles Logger.getLogger(this.getClass().getName()).log(Level. [...]statements into catch blocks. Now I would like to point them all to a file (and to console).Every logging tutorial and such only me tells how to get a specific logger to output into a file, but I assume there is a better way than fixing every automatically generated logging statement? Setting a handler for some sort of root logger or something?
How safe would it be to use functional-java to add closures to a Java production project? : I would love to use closures in Java. I have read that they may or may not make it into Java 7. But an open-source project called a href=http://code.google.com/p/functionaljava/ rel=nofollow noreferrerfunctional-java has implemented functional features including closures. How safe would it be to use such a library in an enterprise production app? Is there a better way to add closures to Java currently?
What are your experiences using the functional java project? : I was reading the following question - a href=http://stackoverflow.com/questions/766745/how-safe-would-it-be-to-use-functional-java-to-add-closures-to-a-java-productionHow safe would it be to use functional-java to add closures to a Java production project? and I had been thinking of using the a href=http://functionaljava.org/ rel=nofollow noreferrerFunctional Java project as well in my current project. I was wondering what are Stack Overflow's users experiences with using the Functional Java project? In particular, I'm curious about some of these specifics:Did it increase code quality or clarity?Improve productivity?Reduce potential points of failure?Impact performance?

Is there a good alternative to javax.imageio out there? : I'm looking for a good alternative to the javax.imageio package, that lets me do simple rotating, cutting and scaling operations on images. For example, I would like to doint angle, height, width;image.rotateRight(angle).scale(height, width);in order to obtain an image that is rotated angle degrees to the right and scaled down to height x width pixels.Using Graphics2D and BufferedImages, I will have to do this, which is neither readable, nor easy to write:BufferedImage result = new BufferedImage(width, height, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB);Graphics2D graphics = result.createGraphics();graphics.translate(height/2, width/2);graphics.rotate(angle);graphics.translate(-width/2, -height/2);graphics.drawImage(image, 0, 0, width, height, null);(Actually, that code doesn't even account for non-square images, which will require me to do even more magic with the translating).
How to make canvas with Swing? : I'm trying to make a paint editor with Java in which I have a toolbar with the objects that I would like to paste in the canvas. I'm using Swing components to make the GUI, but when I looked for the way of making the canvas, I only found the class canvas from AWT. Is there any way to make something similar to canvas with Swing? (for example, JPanel?) I have read that using the class canvas from AWT with a GUI made with swing won't work correctly, is that true?
Java WebStart: property ... ignored when using ? : I have a problem modernizing a Java WebStart application under Java 6 u 13 (the latest at this moment)We desire to use the new  mechanism to have several master configuration files each with their own configuration , which then include another  jnlp file which is autogenerated to ensure that the jar list is accurate.

Creating animated GIF with ImageIO? : Has anybody managed to convince ImageIO to write an animated GIF, and in particular setting the correct metadata? My first attempt is roughly as follows (where b1 and b2 are BufferedImages):ImageTypeSpecifier spec = new ImageTypeSpecifier(b1);ImageWriter wr = ImageIO.getImageWriters(spec, GIF).next();wr.setOutput(ImageIO.createImageOutputStream(new File(C:\\Flashing.gif)));ImageWriteParam param = wr.getDefaultWriteParam();IIOMetadata meta = wr.getDefaultImageMetadata(spec, param);wr.prepareWriteSequence(meta);wr.writeToSequence(new IIOImage(b1, null, null), param);wr.writeToSequence(new IIOImage(b2, null, null), param);This appears to almost work, but:I clearly need to somehow set proper metadata to set the time between the images and ideally make them loop (I was naively hoping the default would do something sensible, but hey...)whatever metadata it is writing by default is obviously not quite right: the GIMP gives a couple of error messages when loading the file, although embedding the image in a test web page in Firefox does display the two images in very quick succession, which is tantilisingly close to what I want...If anyone has got writing animated GIFs from ImageIO to work and can share a snippet of working code or how to fix the above problems, it would be greatly appreciated!
javax.comm: Error when device is disconnected : I have an application that reads data from a com port using javax.comm.The problem I am having is that if the device that I'm reading from is unexpectedly disconnected I get an error in the console that says WaitCommEvent: Error 5I have looked around and can't find any helpful information about this.  I have set all of the notifyOn* methods to true so I think I should be receiving all of the events but I'm not catching this one.The error message that is printed out does not come from anywhere in my code so it must be in the javax.comm package somewhere. Can anyone tell me how to handle this error so that I can close the com port properly when it occurs?Thanks!
Load java.util.logging.config.file for default initialization : I'm trying to load a custom log.properties file when my application is started.My properties file is in the same package as my main class, so I assumed that the -Djava.util.logging.config.file=log.properties command line parameter should get the properties file loaded.But the properties are only loaded when i specify a full absolute path to the properties file. Any suggestions how to use a relative path?
Access non-public classes in sun.awt package [specifically: FetcherInfo] : Question:I have some performance problem in my app - and the bottleneck is sun.awt.image.ImageFetcher.run, and I canno't get any (more) meaningfull info from profiler. So I figured that it would be nice to look at jobs that ImageFetcher is doing. I couldn't get access to FetcherInfo class, that holds all ImageFetcher jobs. To obtain FetcherInfo instance I have to call FetcherInfo.getFetcherInfo(). I created class in package sun.awt.image (just in my project, i didnt tinker with rt.jar). To get FetcherInfo i use: try{   for(Method method : FetcherInfo.class.getDeclaredMethods()){      method.setAccessible(true);      if(method.getName().equals(getFetcherInfo)){         m = method;      }   }}catch (Exception e){   e.printStackTrace();}FetcherInfo info = null;try {   info = (FetcherInfo) m.invoke(null);} catch (IllegalAccessException e) {   e.printStackTrace();} catch (InvocationTargetException e) {   e.printStackTrace();}And I get exception: Exception in thread IMAGE-FETCHER-WATCHER java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access class sun.awt.image.FetcherInfo from class sun.awt.image.FetcherDebugAnd the stack trace points to:for(Method method : FetcherInfo.class.getDeclaredMethods()){The same exception was raised by:  FetcherInfo.class.getMethod(getFetcherInfo);So anyone has any ideas how to either:Obtain ImageFetcher instanceFind out what images are getting loadedSOLUTIONThe problem was that i've put my class into sun.java.awt package to get access to package protected members, without putting it into rt.jar, and exception was thrown hen calling ImageFetcher.class.
Is it possible to use Java webstart execute .exe or dll? : I know java webstart is running under a secure sandbox. Is it possible to include a .dll/.exe in the jar (or have the webstart download it to the local machine) and then execute it (using Runtime.exec or process,etc)Please Advise. Any suggestion/comment is welcome!
How to embed Java Web Start (with jnlp) application on google? : I have created some simple app in Java, and 'deployed' it using Java Web Start (and jnlp) on my local machine. Now I would like to put it on the web, to have some feedback from various people.I was thinking about embedding my app in Google infrastructure (pages.google.com/sites.google.com/blogger.com - whatever).

Java WebStart and endorsed directories : How do I specify in java webstart .jnlp file, that some of my jars are overriding the JRE builtin implementations? Just like the endorsed lib property on a regular application.
Convert static windows library to dll : I have a library contains a bunch of static *lib files, I wish to access them from JNA (a Java library that allows one to dynamically call `dll's from JAVA Code), so is there a way to magically change static lib to dll? Code was compiled using Visual studio (hope that is relevant), and I also have appropriate header files.I do not have access to source code, also I would like to do it using only free (as in beer) tools. 
Debugger won't work with JMockit : Hopefully an easy question here for someone.....I'm using RAD 7.5.2, and am writing Junit tests.  I was writing them just fine with JUnit 3, and then I wanted to mock up some function calls.  So I loaded up jmockit 0.9.7 and Junit 4.6.  I also include -javaagent:jmockit.jar as a VM argument.When I Run As Junit Test, it goes along with no problems at all (at least, none that I can see on the output).  The output of Junit is good, and no errors are dumped to the console.When I Debug as Junit Test, it won't work.  It dumps me out into:InstrumentationImpl.class -- Source not found...and when I hit continue....NativeMethodAccessorImpl.class -- Source not found...and when I hit continue...The JUnit ends after this.  It dumps the following to the console:Exception in thread main java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException    at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)    at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:79)    at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:618)    at sun.instrument.InstrumentationImpl.loadClassAndCallPremain(InstrumentationImpl.java:160)Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: sun/instrument/InstrumentationImpl.redefineClasses0([Ljava/lang/instrument/ClassDefinition;)V    at sun.instrument.InstrumentationImpl.redefineClasses(InstrumentationImpl.java:98)    at mockit.internal.RedefinitionEngine.redefineMethods(RedefinitionEngine.java:197)    at mockit.internal.RedefinitionEngine.redefineMethods(RedefinitionEngine.java:184)    at mockit.internal.RedefinitionEngine.redefineMethods(RedefinitionEngine.java:116)    at mockit.internal.RedefinitionEngine.setUpInternalStartupMock(RedefinitionEngine.java:53)    at mockit.internal.Startup.loadInternalStartupMocks(Startup.java:123)    at mockit.internal.Startup.initialize(Startup.java:110)    at mockit.internal.Startup.premain(Startup.java:97)    ... 5 moreFatal error: processing of -javaagent failedI can run both JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 on my tests with no problem, it's when I use the -javaagent:jmockit.jar (with the debugger; by themselves they're fine) that things get ugly, and I have to do that to use the jmockit stuff.Thoughts?
How do I start my Java program with more than one java agent? : I'm aware of how to start a java progam with a java agent:java -javaagent:myAgent.jar MyJavaProgramBut what if I want to add 2 or more java agents to instrument my program?

How to learn game development? : I've been a web programmer for a while and I can also program in Java. I have an idea for a small, multiplayer RPG game that I want to work on. It will be played through a java applet in the user's web browser.I have written the design document and specifications of the gameplay. What I'd like to know now is how I can develop the game? I've worked only with windows-like business apps in the past, with built-in widgets for textboxes, dropdowns, etc. With game programming it seems that I would have to build my own widget/controls for the UI of the game.These are the specific questions I have in mind:1) How to display a 'loading...' message with a progress bar while the game's images, sound, etc are being downloaded. (Using the java applet)2) How to create the UI of the game with its own menu, controls, etc. Such as by clicking the map icon it would show up a map to them. Clicking the friends icon would let them chat to their friends, etc.3) And other, general game development issues that i should know about, like whether I should use 2D or 3D graphics,  physics in games, etc.If there's a good recommendation for a book that will help me, do share.
Deleting Java's temporary internet files : In the Java Control Panel on Windows there are settings for temporary internet files wherein all the applets and webstart stuff is cached. For certain users of our application this caching doesn't work properly and they need to delete all the files through the control panel before our webstart application will update itself properly.Overlooking the other implications of doing so, is there anyway we can programmatically delete the temporary file cache when we do an update, preferably through Java and without resorting to any batch file or Windows hackery quackery?

How to allow running only one instance of a Java program at a time? : I need to prevent users from starting my Java application (WebStart Swing app) multiple times. So if the application is already running it shouldn't be possible to start it again or show a warning / be closed again.Is there some convenient way to achieve this? I thought about blocking a port or write sth to a file. But hopefully you can access some system properties or the JVM?btw. target platform is Windows XP with Java 1.5
Applet (or WebStart application) calling a server : best practices? : I'd like to write an applet (or a java Web start application) calling its server (servlet?) to invoke some methods and to send/retrieve data. What would be the best way/technology to send and to retrieve those message ? 
Eclipse warning about synthetic accessor for private static nested classes in Java? : My coworker suggested making several of the Eclipse code-formatting and warning settings to be more rigorous. The majority of these changes make sense, but I get this one weird warning in Java. Here's some test code to reproduce the problem:package com.example.bugs;public class WeirdInnerClassJavaWarning {    private static class InnerClass    {        public void doSomething() {}    }    final private InnerClass anInstance;    {        this.anInstance = new InnerClass();   // !!!        this.anInstance.doSomething();    }}// using this.anInstance instead of anInstance prevents another warning,// Unqualified access to the field WeirdInnerClassJavaWarning.anInstance    The line with the !!! gives me this warning in Eclipse with my new warning settings:blockquote  Access to enclosing constructor  WeirdInnerClassJavaWarning.InnerClass()  is emulated by a synthetic accessor  method. Increasing its visibility will  improve your performance./blockquoteWhat does this mean? The warning goes away when I change private static class to protected static class, which makes no sense to me.edit: I finally figured out the correct fix. The real problem here seems to be that this nested private static class is missing a public constructor. That one tweak removed the warning:package com.example.bugs;public class WeirdInnerClassJavaWarning {    private static class InnerClass    {        public void doSomething() {}        public InnerClass() {}    }    final private InnerClass anInstance;    {        this.anInstance = new InnerClass();        this.anInstance.doSomething();    }}I want the class to be a private nested class (so no other class can have access to it, including subclasses of the enclosing class) and I want it to be a static class.I still don't understand why making the nested class protected rather than private is another method of fixing the problem, but maybe that is a quirk/bug of Eclipse.(apologies, I should have called it NestedClass instead of InnerClass to be more clear.)
why do I get UnsupportedClassVersionError in jnlp? : I get an UnsupportedClassVersionError thrown when launching jnlp, however when I try to run the relevant jar files from command line everything works fine. I tried setting j2se versions to 1.5+, 1.6+, using signed/unsigned jar files, but all that doesn't help.I'm trying to launch my own jar file with two supporting jar files (mysql-connector.jar and swingx.jar). My jar file has been compiled with 1.6 compliance settings in Eclipse and built into a jar with ant. Since I can launch the 3 jars from command line using java 1.6 I'm a bit baffled that jnlp fails. Any help is appreciated.Here is the jnlp file:?xml version=1.0 encoding=utf-8?!-- JNLP File --jnlp spec=1.5+ codebase=http://www.etc.com/p href=demo-daily.jnlp information  titledemo: daily stock charting utility/title  offline-allowed/ /information security /security resources  j2se href=http://java.sun.com/products/autodl/j2se version=1.6+ /  jar href=demo-daily.jar main=true /  jar href=swingx.jar main=false /  jar href=mysql-connector.jar main=false / /resources application-desc main-class=quipu.viewers.charts.stockcharts.daily//jnlpThe error I get is:java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: Bad version number in .class fileat java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method)at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:675)at java.security.SecureClassLoader.defineClass(SecureClassLoader.java:124)at java.net.URLClassLoader.defineClass(URLClassLoader.java:260)at java.net.URLClassLoader.access$100(URLClassLoader.java:56)at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:195)at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:188)at com.sun.jnlp.JNLPClassLoader.findClass(JNLPClassLoader.java:256)at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:316)at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:251)at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.doLaunchApp(Launcher.java:1052)at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.run(Launcher.java:105)at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:613)
Why some times Java does not request for new versions of jar files? : Every time we update our Java application (Java client and Java server) we have the problems that some clients approx. 1% - 2% does not load the new jar files. This occur with applets and also with Java Web Start. If you clear the Java Cache then all is working correct.Any idea why Java does not check for new jar files on every start?
Why the jpg file I converted from a gif file isn't crisp and clear? : I use the following code to convert a gif file to a jpg file, it works but the result jpg file isn't the same quality as the original gif file, why ? Any way to improve the quality ?try{  ImageIO.write(ImageIO.read(new File(C:/abc.gif)),jpg,new File(C:/abc.jpg));}catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }So, to ask this question from another angle, with the above approach, how to increase the output quality ?
How to regulate the amount of printouts generated by a logging instruction produces over time? : How can I limit a program log printouts to a maximum of X printouts within Y seconds?Programming server side with java.util.logging, my code has a lot of info, warning, and error statements like:s_logger.logp(Level.WARNING, myClassName, myMethodName, msg.code.in.properties.file);On the one hand, I do want to see the warning message above printed to the STDOUT, since it serves an indication that something went wrong, especially when investigating problems in production, but on the other hand, printing numerous lines that tells the same story over a short period of time, has no added value but instead hit performance and introduces scrolling blindness.  What I'm looking for is a mechanism/API that could regulate the printouts to no more than x messages, per message code, during y seconds. For example, over the course of a minute, I don't want to generate and write to the log more than 10 messages of the type: transaction timed out.  I'd be happy for a API or a library reference, Anyone?
Dynamicly generate a JNLP file for a Java Web Start application? : I'm writing a servlet to return a JNLP file with several dynamically generated parameters to be passed to a web start program.  Right now my code uses a stock template and token replacement, but I have to think there is a way to generate this file programmaticly within a servlet.Are there any tools available for this?
Using Netbeans to design GUIs and the ability to start with Web Start : I designed a GUI program using Netbeans 6.5 on a computer running Vista.  I uploaded it to my server and tested out the web start.  It worked fine.Later when using a Mac, it was not able to work.  I tested it out in Ubuntu and was unsuccessful as well.  I even tried to compile the source code on Ubuntu and I got this:Task required to generate JNLP file is missing, probably the library 'JWS Ant Tasks' is missing either from shared folder or from IDE installation.Basically the Java Desktop Application ran fine on the Windows computer but will not run on other computers.  I just created a test Application on the Ubuntu computer, uploaded it and it ran fine.How come the program I compiled and ran yesterday on a computer running Vista will not run on Ubuntu? Thanks.
Retrieve an image from the web in java : I am trying to read an image that resides somewhere on the web from my Java program. So far I have successfully loaded an image by using the following code.URL url = new URL(http://www.google.com/images/nav_logo4.png);Image img = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getImage(url);What I want to know is why this code (which is the first i tried) does not work:BufferedImage img = ImageIO.read(new File(http://www.google.com/images/nav_logo4.png));This would have the benefit of giving me a BufferedImage. Also, how can I make the above code block until the image is loaded? I know I can use an ImageObserver, but is there a simpler way?When I try the second option, I get this exception:javax.imageio.IIOException: Can't read input file!
Java Code for calculating Leap Year : I am following The Art and Science of Java book and it shows how to calculate a leap year.The book uses ACM Java Task Force's library.Here is the code the books uses:import acm.program.*;public class LeapYear extends ConsoleProgram {    public void run()    {        println(This program calculates leap year.);        int year = readInt(Enter the year: );             boolean isLeapYear = ((year % 4 == 0) amp;amp; (year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0));        if (isLeapYear)        {            println(year +  is a leap year.);        } else            println(year +  is not a leap year.);    }}Now, this is how I calculated the leap year. import acm.program.*;public class LeapYear extends ConsoleProgram {    public void run()    {        println(This program calculates leap year.);        int year = readInt(Enter the year: );        if ((year % 4 == 0) amp;amp; year % 100 != 0)        {            println(year +  is a leap year.);        }        else if ((year % 4 == 0) amp;amp; (year % 100 == 0) amp;amp; (year % 400 == 0))        {            println(year +  is a leap year.);        }        else        {            println(year +  is not a leap year.);        }    }}Is there anything wrong with my code or should i use the one provided by the book ?EDIT :: Both of the above code works fine, What i want to ask is which code is the best way to calculate the leap year. 
Java webstart Security : What is the option in Java Webstart command line to skip the security check?  This is for testing purposes only.javaws myfile.jar
Java Webstart Options : I am using javaws to run an application in OS X 10.5.7, Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_13-b03-211), and it seems that the command line arugments are broken in os X.  I run the following command in linux and it works fine.javaws -wait   -J-Djavaws.package.runtype=debug http://company.com/launch.jnlpand the runtime gives me the property javaws.package.runtype=debug.  But when I run the same arugment in os X, I get  jnlpx.vmargs = -Djavaws.package.runtype=debugIs this an error, or just an unknown feature?
JWS JNLP no Desktop Icon on Mac : I seem to be having a problem getting the icon for a Java Web Start program to appear on the Mac desktop, or under Applications. The icon's and menu's are created and work properly under windows XP and Vista, is there something different that must be done for Macs?On the Mac there aren't output any errors, it prompts me with the question if I would like to create the shortcuts, I click yes, and then it continues launching the program but never seems to produce them.
Threadsafe publishing of java object structure? : Assuming that I have the following code:final Catalog catalog = createCatalog();for (int i = 0; i 100; i++{    new Thread(new CatalogWorker(catalog)).start();}Catalog is an object structure, and the method createCatalog() and the Catalog object structure has not been written with concurrency in mind. There are several non-final, non-volatile references within the product catalog, there may even be mutable state (but that's going to have to be handled)The way I understand the memory model, this code is not thread-safe. Is there any simple way to make it safe ?  (The generalized version of this problem is really about single-threaded construction of shared structures that are created before the threads explode into action)
Can I use Scanner class in text file for getting information? : this code is correct??String note = text.txt;FileWriter file = new FileWriter(note);Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);System.out.println(Enter your name:);String name = sc.next();file.close();How can I pass this file to the program as a command line argument???
JPA EntityManager: Why use persist() over merge()? : EntityManager.merge() can insert new objects and update existing ones.Why would one want to use persist() (which can only create new objects)?
Using Scanner.next() to get text input : I am trying to get text input from the keyboard in Java 6.  I am new to the language and whenever i run the following code, I get this error:package test1;import java.util.Scanner;public class Test {public static void main(String[] args) {    boolean quit = false;    while (!quit){        Scanner keyIn;        String c = x;        while (c != y amp;amp; c != n) {            keyIn = new Scanner(System.in);            c = keyIn.next();            keyIn.close();        }        if (c == n)            quit = true;    } }}Exception in thread main java.util.NoSuchElementExceptionat java.util.Scanner.throwFor(Scanner.java:838)at java.util.Scanner.next(Scanner.java:1347)at test1.Test.main(Test.java:11)Am I mis-using the next() method?

Recommended way to send email from a web app? : I have a web app on JBoss 4.2.3 and I'd like it to send email. I could do something like:try {Properties props = System.getProperties();props.put(mail.transport.protocol, smtp );props.put(mail.smtp.starttls.enable,false );props.put(mail.smtp.host,smtp.somehost.com);props.put(mail.smtp.auth, true );Authenticator auth = new SMTPAuthenticator();Session session = Session.getInstance(props, auth);// -- Create a new message --Message msg = new MimeMessage(session);// -- Set the FROM and TO fields --msg.setFrom(new InternetAddress(me@somehost.com));msg.setRecipients(Message.RecipientType.TO,InternetAddress.parse(recipient@somewhere.com, false));msg.setSubject(yadayada);msg.setText(Yada yada);// -- Set some other header information --msg.setHeader(MyMail, Mr. XYZ );msg.setSentDate(new Date());// -- Send the message --Transport.send(msg);}catch (Exception ex) {  ex.printStackTrace();  System.out.println(Exception +ex);}but it doesn't feel right. Will this scale?
input/output with Java Web Start : I'm working on converting a very simple java desktop application to run in java web start and I'm having all kinds of trouble with the input/output files.  Most specifically I can't seem to find any information on how to handle i/o in a web start application.  I tried placing the input files in the same folder on my web server as the jar and jnlp file, but it doesn't read it.I've got one input file that I want to keep on the web server and read into the application from there.  I've got a second file that I want the application to generate on the client machine the first time it's run, and read in from there every time thereafter.If anyone knows what considerations I need to take for i/o in java web start or can point me towards a resource that explains it I would appreciate it.
Trouble understanding :state in Clojure : I understand what :state /does/. It creates a field, like in Java, in your class. What I don't understand is what is the point of this? It seems like I only see it done with Clojure-generated classes that extend other classes. a href=http://www.fatvat.co.uk/2009/05/clojure-and-robocode.html rel=nofollow noreferrerhttp://www.fatvat.co.uk/2009/05/clojure-and-robocode.html being one example. I don't know Java, and I'm not very well versed in Object Oriented Programming. Can someone explain the point of :state to me, and where it all fits in with Java interop?Thanks a lot!NOTE: When I say :state, I am referring to (:gen-class :state)
When you extend a Java class in Clojure and define a method of the same name as one in that class, what is happening? : I've been reading through Programming Clojure, and I've been having some trouble understanding Stuarts primary Java Interop example. He extends DefaultHandler, and creates a startElement method, and then passes that handler to an XML parser. What I don't understand, is what exactly is happening. Does his implementation of startElement override the one defined in DefaultHandler? I'm confused. I have no experience with Java, and little with object orientation.Thanks!
Can I supress the loading dialogs in Java Web Start? : I'm trying to put together a Java Webstart app, but don't want it to display the Webstart splash screen, or downloading app boxes. Is there any way I can turn them off? (I'm fine with it displaying the Permissions Request box, but nothing else).
Launching a browser window from Java WebStart (JNLP) in Java 6u13+ : There is a bug in Java 6u13 and 6u14. a href=http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6835450 rel=nofollow noreferrerhttp://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6835450Simply put, the following code is supposed to open a browser window, but because of a bug in the framework, it stopped working in Java 1.6 update 13. Nothing opens anymore. There was a similar bug for Java applets (that was fixed in update 14), but this one still exists in update 14 for Java WebStart/JNLP. getAppletContext().showDocument(new URL(http://www.sun.com),_blank);Do you know of any workarounds? 
Oracle Java Stored Procedure Command-line Interaction : I have a funny requirement.We need to have a command-line interaction in a Java Stored Procedure.

In the Java code I looked at, it was simply called like so:getCodeBase()Am I missing something?

Is there a faster way to deploy WSIT Services than autodeploy? : We've recently upgraded our services technology stack. We opted for the WSIT implementation of JAX-WS.Currently, we're relying on our Glassfish Application Server to deploy the web service automatically based on the JAX-WS annotations.  We have about two dozen different services and hundreds of operations, so this autodeployment takes quite a while.  Is there a faster way to deploy than autodeployment?What I'm looking for is something that can do the work at compile time or build time instead.
Convert Byte Array to image in Java - without knowing the type : Sounds simple right? Use ImageIO.read(new ByteArrayInputStream(bytes));Here's the wrinkle. For some reason it is detecting a jpeg as a bmp, and that is the first ImageReader returned when I call ImageInputStream iis = ImageIO.createImageInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(bytes));IteratorImageReader readers=ImageIO.getImageReaders(iis);This causes the image to come out corrupted. Is there a way to tell through java short of looking directly at the bytes for the header, and failing that does anyone know of a good reference for the byte headers for the different images? Just letting you guys know I am still working on this. I'll let you know if/when I have an answer. I thank all of you for your responses so far.

Problem with matching token in a line, using Scanner in Java : I need to match certain things from lines of an input text. The lines look like this: to be/ Σ _ Σ  [1pos, 1neg] {0=1, 2=1}I am using the Scanner class to read each line of the text, and I have written the following code. However, something is not working properly, because the patter to is not matched against the line, and it should be, because to is contained in the line (I have tried to match not only to from the line, but nothing matches): Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file); while(scanner.hasNext()) {      String line = scanner.nextLine();      System.out.println(line:  + line);      Pattern p_pos = Pattern.compile(to);      Matcher m_pos = p_pos.matcher(line);      String match = m_pos.group(0);      System.out.println(match:  + match);      boolean b_pos = m_pos.matches();      if(b_pos) {          System.out.println(match);      } }Output:line:    to be/ Σ _ Σ  [1pos, 1neg] {0=1, 2=1}Exception in thread main java.lang.IllegalStateException: No match found    at java.util.regex.Matcher.group(Matcher.java:485)    at lady.PhrasesFromFile.readFile(PhrasesFromFile.java:31)    at lady.PhrasesFromFile.main(PhrasesFromFile.java:17)I have one more question: how can I process the line so that I store everything from the beginning of the line till the first / symbol? I couldn't find any method for that in the API. Is it possible to do so? I basically want consecutively to go through the line, store pieces of the line in different variables, and then use the values of these variables. Since I do not know how many token I have before the first / symbol, I cannot use next() a certain number of times.Thank you in advance. 
Setting java.util.logging destination programmatically : I'm using java.util.logging for logging and tracing purposes. How can I within a Java application dynamically set the file to which the log should be written.

Javaagent class unloading : I have a java agent which instruments bytecode.I am using the attach apis in java 6 to allow users to dynamically load the agent and instrument and deinstrument code using my java agent.I am using the Boot-Class-Path manifest attribute to make sure my javagent classes are in the boot classpath so that my users can instrument classes like ArrayList, etc.However the problem comes with versioning.Lets say a user dynamically attaches version 1 of my agent.Then I given him version 2. Now since his app server never shut down since he attached version 1 of my agent, the version 1 classes are still loaded. I need some way such that when my client version 2 of the javaagent, the version 1 is unloaded.I know one way would be to write a customer classloader for my javaagent's classes, and set the classloader reference to null.However in that case I wont be able to instrument classes in the boot classpath since my classloader will be below in the hierarchy from the boot classloader and thus my users cant instrument classes like ArrayList because if I add a call inside ArrayList's methods to one of my agent's classes' methods the boot class loader wont be able to see them.So is there any way to solve the boot classpath issue and still unload the previous agent's classes?
Launch Runnable Jar from Web Start : This is my first time trying to use Web Start, and I am trying to launch my runnable jar.

ASM bytecode instrumentation for method entry / exit : I've created a JVMTI agent that does the following at a high level:onClassLoadHook send the bytecodes for the loaded class to a separate Java process that will instrument the class using ASMget the bytecodes back and load themIn my seperate java process that instruments the loaded Java class I do the following :....    cr = new ClassReader(inBytes, offset, inLen);    cw = new ClassWriter(ClassWriter.COMPUTE_FRAMES);    ClassAdapter ca = new ClassAdapter(cw) {    ..    ..        @Override        public MethodVisitor visitMethod(final int access,                                         final String name,                                         final String desc,                                         String signature,                                         String[] exceptions) {            return new MethodAdapter(mv) {                @Override                public void visitCode() {                    mv.visitVarInsn(Opcodes.ALOAD, 0);                    mv.visitMethodInsn(Opcodes.INVOKESTATIC, com/amir/Tester, callTestStatic3, (Ljava/lang/Object;)V);                    mv.visitCode();                }            }        }When I try to decompile the class that is written after this instrumentation using Java Decompiler - I see the following decompiled function which I know is wrong :  public void func1(int arg1, int arg2)  {    int b;    Tester.callTestStatic3(???);     System.out.println(arg =  + a +  b =  + b);  }because my function actually looks like this :public void func1(int a, int b) {    System.out.println(arg =  +a +  b =  +b);}Can anyone tell me if I did something wrong here?  My only clue is that if instead of passing in as an argument to my function the THIS pointer, if I pass in primitive types, everything works out finie.  Is there something special about the THIS pointer that I need to manage?  I've compared the bytecodes, and I've used ASMIFIER to get a clue as to what statements I need to use to generate the right bytecodes.
Why Java ImageIO flattens JPEG colors : When I read certain JPG files, colors are flattened. Here is a simple example that reads a jpg and just writes the same image to another file.import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;import java.io.File;import javax.imageio.ImageIO;public class JPegReadTest {    public static void main(String[] args) {        if (args.length == 2) {            try {                BufferedImage src = ImageIO.read(new File(args[0]));                ImageIO.write(src, jpg, new File(args[1]));            } catch (Exception e) {                e.printStackTrace();            }        } else {            System.err.println(Usage: java JPegReadTest src dest);        }    }}If you try this with for example a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/visualpanic/233508614/sizes/l/ rel=nofollow noreferrerhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/visualpanic/233508614/sizes/l/ , the colors of the destination image differ from the source file. Why is that? How to fix it?Also tried saving the image as png, but the colors are bland in it too (so assuming color info is not read properly).
Starting a Java agent after program start : Is it possible to insert a javaagent after virtual machine start from within the same VM?Lets say for example we have an agent in a jar myagent.jar with the appropriate meta data set-up and an agentmain method already implemented. Now the users program calls an API call which should result in the insertion of the agent so that it can redefine the classes.Can it be done and how?
JNLP doesn't show splash screen when launching from a desktop icon : I have been able to create a JNLP file, which successfully sets up a splash screen amp; a desktop icon for a Java program launched through Web Start. Here's the relevant chunk of the JNLP:    Now, to launch the program, I find I can either click on the JNLP, in which case the splash screen shows, or on the desktop icon, in which case the default Java Web Start splash screen shows instead. This is on Windows XP amp; Windows Vista, and it's Java 1.5 and Java 1.6.Is there a way to get my splash screen to show when launching from the JNLP file, instead of the Java one?Thanks.

How to get line number using scanner : I'm using scanner to read a text file line by line but then how to get line number since scanner iterates through each input?My program is something like this:s = new Scanner(new BufferedReader(new FileReader(input.txt)));while (s.hasNext()) {System.out.print(s.next());This works fine but for example:1,2,3 3,4,5I want to know line number of it which mean 1,2,3 is in line 1 and 3,4,5 is in line 2.How do I get that?
How to recreate shortcut to webstart application? : I use the shortcut tag in my appliation's jnlp descriptor to create a desktop link and a menu entry for my application.If these shortcuts get deleted on the client - how can they be reinstalled automatically without user action? Is there a configuration option for the jnlp file?(btw I'm using java6)
How to get updated jnlp file when using shortcuts? : If my jnlp descriptor on the server changes and I start my application from the browser, a new jnlp file will be created in the cache and my desktop shortcuts will be updated to use the new jnlp file. (that's good so far).But if I start my app using the desktop shortcut (or the menu entry), then my app won't know about the changed jnlp file on the server and will still use the cached outdated one.Is it possible to force webstart not only to get the newest jarfiles but also update the jnlp file itsself when starting the app?Background: I pass some parameters to my application (defined in the descriptor with the argument tag) to configure my app. If these arguments are changed - this must work of course too when using the shortcut.I'm using java6 (u15).EDIT: actually i've found this a href=http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do;jsessionid=b5fd9a3ad1e340ddfe9b1bbce00?bug_id=6838214 rel=nofollow noreferrerjava bug 6838214 which seems to refer to my problem I think. If I interpret it correctly this should have been fixed in java6u14, but under u15 I still have this issue!
Deploying an SWT application on Java Webstart : Is it possible to deploy SWT applications using JNLP. Especially loading the swt native library (dll in Windows, so in Linux)? Any links? I found one at a href=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-jws/ rel=nofollow noreferrerIBM Developer Works, however it just describes using swt.jar. In addition to that, is it possible to load the native dll files over JNLP?
Does a Java Scanner implicitly create a buffer even if you do not pass it one? : If I have the following example file where each number is represents a byte (123 has bytes 1, 2, and 3):123456789Let's say I create a FileInputStream. This reads in the binary byte by byte. So .read() returns 1, then 2, etc. Now let's say I create a buffer. The initial chunk it reads in (if I understand buffers correctly) is 1-5. This allows it to not only read in byte by byte, but in the case of characters whole lines, etc. But if I hit .read() again, I start at 6, and NOT where the BufferedReader stopped (so if 3 is a line break, and I told the BufferedReader to print the first line, it prints 1-2, and then using .read() from the FileInputStream gives me 6, and not 3.)In order to be able to parse data by the delimiter, does a Scanner implicitly create a buffer like how a BufferedReader creates a buffer so that it can find line breaks, etc? And if I pass a separate FileInputStream into the Scanner, using .read() will NOT print the first byte following the first delimiter the scanner found, but rather at the end of the chunk the scanner took?
JavaWebStart app randomly fails : I have a JAR signed with a self-signed certificate and deployed by JWS.It usually runs ok (most of the times) but sometimes fails which is quite annoying, It shows the splashscreen but nothing else.These are the last log lines:recorddate2009-09-08T16:55:33/datemillis1252421733468/millissequence173/sequenceloggercom.sun.deploy/loggerlevelFINE/levelclasscom.sun.deploy.util.LoggerTraceListener/classmethodprint/methodthread10/threadmessagenetwork: Conectando socket://127.0.0.1:4590 con proxy=DIRECT/message/recordrecorddate2009-09-08T16:55:37/datemillis1252421737171/millissequence174/sequenceloggercom.sun.deploy/loggerlevelFINE/levelclasscom.sun.deploy.util.LoggerTraceListener/classmethodprint/methodthread10/threadmessagesecurity: JAVAWS AppPolicy Permission requested for: http://127.0.0.1/ikuspro/ikuspro.jar/message/recordrecorddate2009-09-08T16:55:37/datemillis1252421737171/millissequence175/sequenceloggercom.sun.deploy/loggerlevelFINE/levelclasscom.sun.deploy.util.LoggerTraceListener/classmethodprint/methodthread10/threadmessagesecurity: We were not granted permission, exiting/message/record/logAnd this is my jnlp file?xml version=1.0 encoding=utf-8?!-- Fichero JNLP de Ikuspro --jnlp spec=6.0 codebase=http://127.0.0.1/ikuspro href=ikuspro.jnlpinformationtitleIkuspro/titlevendorMyName/vendorhomepage href=/descriptionIkuspro/descriptiondescription kind=shortDesc+/descriptionicon href=ikusproLogo.png/icon kind=splash href=splash.png/offline-allowed/shortcut online=truedesktop/menu submenu=Ikuspro//shortcut/informationsecurityall-permissions//securityupdate check=timeout policy=prompt-update/updateresourcesj2se version=1.6 java-vm-args=-esa -Xnoclassgc/jar href=ikuspro.jar//resourcesapplication-desc main-class=ikuspro.main.Ikuspro//jnlpAs I've said It doesn't always happen and the certificate has been accepted permanently.Besides I see that the debugging is in FINE level, How can I make it more verbose?Thanks in advance
Passing command line arguments to javaws (Java WebStart) executable : Summary for those who might not want to read that much:How do I do this: ? If we could pass ad-hoc command-line args to javaws, then javaws apps could be more like 1st class citizen ordinary application. E.g. we could pass filenames of files to be opened.I would like to know if there is a way to pass ad-hoc command line arguments to the javaws executable. I already know how to specify them in JNLP file:application-desc main-class=org.example.ClassNameargument...While this can be used for what i want to accomplish, i treat this as a workaround.I tried javaws http://example.org/launch.jnlp some CLI args hereBut some CLI args here were just ignored, i think.If we could pass ad-hoc command-line args to javaws, then javaws apps could be more like 1st class citizen ordinary application. E.g. we could pass filenames of files to be opened.Like e.g.javaws [options] http://example.org/launch.jnlp my_file.jpgHaving arguments hardcoded in JNLP does not satisfy this use case.
Java Webstart with Tibco Native Libs : I am trying to deploy an application that uses the native implementation of Tibrv through the TibrvJ library using Java Webstart.I have packaged up all of the Windows dlls from inside c:\tibco\tibrv\bin into a Jar file and have added these to the nativelib element in the JNLP file. I was hoping that webstart would take the dll files from thetibco-7.5.1-nativelibs.jar file and allow them to be loaded via System.loadLibrary which is called from  Tibrv.open(). However it doesn't seem to want to work properly.My JNLP file looks like this:?xml version=1.0 encoding=utf-8?!DOCTYPE jnlp PUBLIC -//Sun Microsystems, Inc//DTD JNLP Descriptor 6.0//EN http://java.sun.com/dtd/JNLP-6.0.dtdjnlp spec=6.0+ codebase=http://somewhere:8080/my-gui/application href=launch.jnlp information  titleMy GUI/title  vendorTechnology/vendor  descriptionDashboard/description  description kind=shortDashboard/description  icon href=icon/Stocks-128x128.png /  offline-allowed /  shortcut online=true   desktop /   menu submenu=Dashboard /  /shortcut /information security  all-permissions / /security update check=always policy=prompt-update / resources  j2se version=1.6+ href=http://java.sun.com/products/autodl/j2se   java-vm-args=-Xmx120M -ea /  property name=log4j.configuration value=live/log4j.xml /  property name=swing.aatext value=true /  jar href=tibrvj-7.5.1.jar /  jar href=dashboard-gui.jar main=true / /resources resources  nativelib href=nativelib/tibco-7.5.1-nativelibs.jar / /resources application-desc main-class=com.somewhere.Main  argumentclasspath:/live/client.xml/argument  argument/live/live.properties/argument /application-desc/jnlp The application launches but as soon as a call is made to open tib then it falls apart with an error along the lines of:[Root exception is TibrvException[error=22,message=Version mismatch: libtibrv version 7.4 does not match version of tibrvj shared library 7.5]]TibrvException[error=901,message=Library not found: tibrvj]]The users have a variety of Tib installations already on their PCs from Tib 7.2 through to 7.5. The Webstart Application only works correctly on a machine with 7.5 installed which matches the Jar file inside the package. So it doesn't appear to do anything with the nativelib jar.I would like to avoid having to deploy 3 versions of the web start application for the different versions of Tib that the users have installed.Has anyone else managed to get this combination of TibrvJ and Webstart working?

What I'm doing is simple - When instrumenting a method, if the instruction is a PUTFIELD, simply do a DUP_X1 right before the instruction, then visit the PUTFIELD and inject a function call with an argument that includes the DUP'ed stack entry.                public void visitFieldInsn(                                int opcode,                                String owner,  // owner of this field...

Where is the source code for /jre/lib/deploy.jar? : Where is the source code for /jre/lib/deploy.jar?I have the source code for other jars like rt.jar (in /src.zip) but not deploy.jar.I need it to debug webstart.I'm using 1.6 on Windows if that makes a difference.
java 6 web services share domain specific classes between server and client :  Context:  Considering below defined Engine class being parameter of some webservice method. As we have both server and client in java we may have some benefits (???) in sharing Engine class between server and client ( i.e we may put in a common jar file to be added to both client and server classpath ) Some benefits would be :  we keep specific operations like 'brushEngine' in same place   build is faster as we do not need in our case to generate java code for client classes but to use them from the server build)     if we later change server implementation for 'brushEngine' this is reflected automatically in client . Questions:  How to share below detailed Engine class using java 6 tools ( i.e wsimport , wsgen etc )?Is there other tools for java that can achieve this sharing ?Is sharing a case that java 6 web services support is missing ?Can this case be reduced to other web service usage patterns?Thanks.Code:public class Engine {   private String engineData;   public String getData(){        return data;   }   public setData(String value){        this.data = value;   }    public void brushEngine(){        engineData = BrushedEngine+engineData;    } }
How do you create a javax.swing.Timer that fires immediately, then every t milliseconds? : Right now, I have code that looks something like this:Timer timer = new javax.swing.Timer(5000, myActionEvent);According to what I'm seeing (and the a href=http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/Timer.html rel=nofollow noreferrerJavadocs for the Timer class), the timer will wait 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds), fire the action event, wait 5000 milliseconds, fire again, and so on. However, the behavior that I'm trying to obtain is that the timer is started, the event is fired, the timer waits 5000 milliseconds, fires again, then waits before firing again.Unless I missed something, I don't see a way to create a timer that doesn't wait before firing. Is there a good, clean way to emulate this?

Java: JAXB and using char : I'm working on a project with JAXB but I run into a small problem with JAXB and the char datatype. char gender = 'M';Translates after marshalling into:gender77/genderSo I think that char is mapped to integer, but I simply want to map it to a String. How can I do this? Is it even possible?
Java Scanner class reading strings : I got the following code:        int nnames;    String names[];    System.out.print(How many names are you going to save: );    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);    nnames = in.nextInt();    names = new String[nnames];    for (int i = 0; i  names.length; i++){        System.out.print(Type a name: );        names[i] = in.next();    }    System.out.println(names[0]);When I run this code, the scanner will only pick up the first name and not the last name. And it will sometimes skip a line when trying to enter a name, it will show up as if I had left the name blank and skip to the next name. I don't know what's causing this.I hope someone can help me!EDIT: I have tried in.nextLine(); it fixes the complete names but it still keeps a line, here is an example of the output:How many names are you going to save:  3Type a name: Type a name: John DoeType a name: John Lennon

Image that doesn't show up in IE or Chrome only : I have a jpeg that shows up properly in FF, but won't appear in IE or Chrome. I tried downloading the image and loading it in IE and Chrome directly without success: both browsers shows a broken icon. So this is not a network issue.This file is a result of an image resize by javax.imageio.ImageIO. I have processed over 1000 images successfully.Windows explorer shows the thumbnail properly, and I can edit it successfully in Microsoft Office Picture Manager.Is there any tool that could help me understand what is wrong with this file?
redirecting a java web start app logs to a file : We have an application that we access over Java web start internally at our office.all the logs produced by the app are displayed in Firefox's console.what I want to do is to redirect that to a file.is that possible ?and how to do that ?P.S : the application is designed as follow : a client app that accesses an EJB on a server.the client part is the one made available through java webstart.
How to include external configuration for webstart application : I have webstart application that needs external configuration. Configuration must be external, because it will be changed manually by our customer. I considered adding another jar with this configuration. Application is signed and giving our keys to customer is not a option. I'm leaning towards placing this file to be accessible from web server.How retrive codebase url from webstart application inside or is there a way to configure webstart jnlp file to add other file than jar to classpath?I use maven for complete build, if it is a clue.Any others ideas are acceptable.
Force VM to launch in 32-bit mode WebStart JNLP : I am running a Java 32-bit app on Mac OS X Leopard via Web Start. I need to make sure the VM loads in 32-bit mode. How can I do this in the JNLP?
Using scanner to get input not printing as expected : This is for a friend of mine who is having trouble with Java for school.I do know some programming, but not Java.Scanner kbReader = new Scanner(System.in);System.out.print(Name of item: );String name = kbReader.next();System.out.println(Original price of item: $);double price = kbReader.nextDouble();Outputs:Name of item: CoatOriginal price of item: $10Why is the input for Original price of item: $ on the next line?I was guessing it was because I went from String to double, but can't think of a different way to do it?
Does Java Web Start give a default program folder? : For Java Web Start is there a default place to store and access data related to my program? Or do I need to create a folder? For Java Web Start (assuming I don't get a program folder) is it standard to just create on in Program Files for window, Applications for mac, etc?
SWT and Java WebStart on Mac OS X 10.5 : I am using the most stable SWT Cocoa downloads for Mac OS X and and launching my app via Java WebStart. All jnilib files are within my app jar on its root. The app downloads, verifies, but I cannot get any buttons to respond. I can enter data into all my UI components. My VM arguements are -d32 and -XstartOnFirstThread.The app works fine as a stand alone app bundle (running in 32-bit mode), and works fine running out of Eclipse on the same machine. Is there a known issue with Cocoa SWT (swt-3.5-cocoa-macosx.zip) and WebStart on Mac? The JNLP is pretty standard, so maybe there is a setting that needs to be declared?
Authenticating a Java Web Start Client App : I have a Java Web Start Application which communicates against my server via a web service (over https).I want to restrict the usage of the webservice to my app only, so that 3rd party apps don't work.What strategies to I have? This question is somewhat broad, but running in JWS disables some options, like doing a checksum over all jars (at least I don't know a way of doing this in a JWS environment).I can always implement my own auth scheme, but since the client code is on the client-side, one can always disassemble the class files and crack the auth mechanism. 
Possible to launch JWS applet within browser instead of standalone? : Is it possible to embed an applet in HTML so that it will be displayed within the browser window yet launched through Java Web Start via a JNLP file instead of using the browser's Java plugin?  If so, how is this done?I've only been able to launch my applet in a standalone window, but disliking the user experience pop-ups create, I'd prefer that it be embedded in the browser window.I'd like to use JWS instead of the plugin because I need to control my applet's maximum heap size, which I don't believe is possible with the browser plugin, at least not on Mac OS 10.5.
Using Scanner in Java how can I hasNext(aString) where the string is not regex pattern? : I am trying to do as my question states, sooo I have the following code which would find the match.  String test = scan.next();if (test.equals($let)) return 1;However, I would prefer to use hasNext as to not consume a token; however, when i do the following it fails.if (scan.hasNext($let)) return 1;I realize the when giving has next a variable it expects a pattern, but I thought if i don't have any regex symbols it should work. I also thought $ was possibly some regex symbol so I tried /$ however, that did not work!Thanks for the help!
disable java log rotation : I use java.util.logging.Logger to log in my app :    FileHandler fh=new FileHandler(this.todayFileName, 0, 1, true);    fh.setFormatter(new SimpleFormatter());    Logger.getLogger(rootLogger.getName()).setLevel(Level.ALL);    Logger.getLogger(rootLogger.getName()).addHandler(fh); but this does work well except that log rotation is enabled.and i get files :run.log run.log.1 run.log.2 what I want is to get only one log file, with no rotation enabled.how do I do that ?
Java - Creating a string by selecting certain numbers from within a text file : I have a .txt file that has numbers 1-31 in it called numbers.  I've set up a scanner like this:    cardCreator = new Scanner (new File (numbers));After this, I'm kind of confused on which methods I could use.  I want to set up a conditional statement that will go through numbers, evaluate each line (or numbers 1-31), and include each number a string called numbersonCard, if they meet certain criteria.I can kind of picture how this would work (maybe using hasNext(), or nextLine() or something), but I'm still a little overwhelmed by the API...  Any suggestions as to which methods I might use?
Where is the jar files cached for Java Web Start/JNLP applications? : Where is the jar files cached for Java Web Start/JNLP applications? 
Why would you use logging.properties if App Engine automatically logs stdout  stderr to INFO  WARNING? : According to the documentation for Google App Engine for Java:blockquote  The App Engine Java SDK includes a  template logging.properties file, in  the appengine-java-sdk/config/user/  directory. To use it, copy the file to  your WEB-INF/classes directory (or  elsewhere in the WAR), then the system  property java.util.logging.config.file  to  WEB-INF/classes/logging.properties  (or whichever path you choose,  relative to the application root). You  can set system properties in the  appengine-web.xml file, as follows:/blockquoteappengine-web-app xmlns=http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0    ...    system-properties        property name=java.util.logging.config.file value=WEB-INF/classes/logging.properties /    /system-properties/appengine-web-appblockquote  The Google Plugin for Eclipse new  project wizard creates these logging  configuration files for you, and  copies them to WEB-INF/classes/  automatically. For java.util.logging,  you must set the system property to  use this file./blockquoteIf your write to standard out or standard error, that will automatically get logged as INFO or WARNING. So, why do you need to use a logging.properties file? Does this give you some additional control over your logging?
Java Web Start: unsigned cglib : I am using hibernate on the server side with a client application started via Java Web Start.I can't sign the jars (I'd like to but I can't).

Java  Scala interop: transparent List and Map conversion : I am learning Scala and I have a Java project to migrate to Scala. I want to migrate it by rewriting classes one-by-one and checking that new class didn't break the project.This Java project uses lots of java.util.List and java.util.Map. In new Scala classes I would like to use Scala’s List and Map to have good-looking Scala code.The problem is that new classes (those are wtitten in Scala) do not integrate seamelessly with existing Java code: Java needs java.util.List, Scala needs its own scala.List.Here is a simplified example of the problem. There are classes Main, Logic, Dao. They call each other in a line: Main - Logic - Dao.public class Main {    public void a() {        ListInteger res = new Logic().calculate(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));    }}public class Logic {    public ListInteger calculate(ListInteger ints) {        ListInteger together = new Dao().getSomeInts();        together.addAll(ints);        return together;    }}public class Dao {    public ListInteger getSomeInts() {        return Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3);    }}In my situation, classes Main and Dao are framework classes (I don’t need to migrate them). Class Logic is business-logic and will benefit a lot from Scala cool features.I need to rewrite class Logic in Scala while preserving integrity with classes Main and Dao. The best rewrite would look like (doesn’t work):class Logic2 {  def calculate(ints: List[Integer]) : List[Integer] = {      val together: List[Integer] = new Dao().getSomeInts()      together ++ ints  }}Ideal behaviour: Lists inside Logic2 are native Scala Lists. All in/out java.util.Lists get boxed/unboxed automagically. But this doesn't work.Instead, this does work (thanks to a href=http://github.com/jorgeortiz85/scala-javautils rel=nofollow noreferrerscala-javautils (a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub rel=nofollow noreferrerGitHub)):import org.scala_tools.javautils.Implicits._class Logic3 {  def calculate(ints: java.util.List[Integer]) : java.util.List[Integer] = {      val together: List[Integer] = new Dao().getSomeInts().toScala      (together ++ ints.toScala).toJava  }}But it looks ugly.How do I achieve transparent magic conversion of Lists and Maps between Java - Scala (without need to do toScala/toJava)?If it is not possible, what are the best practices for migrating Java - Scala code that uses java.util.List and friends?
why not use java web start instead of other RIA frameworks? : There are many RIA frameworks popping up (flex, extjs, gwt to name very few). If my server is written in Java, why not use java web start? The benefits I see: I get to program in a language that is easy to debug (compared to javascript), I can use the same code in server and client side (validations, model objects). With SWT I get nice looking GUI.Even if it means requiring a plugin in the browser (or using a cli tool), if my application is an enterprise application, does it matter? 
Java Scanner Headache : I have a text file which looks like:name11 0 1 0 10 1 1 1 00 0 0 0 0name21 0 1 0 10 0 1 1 00 0 0 0 1i.e., a plaintext label followed by a few rows with 1/0 separated by spaces.  The number of rows of 1/0 is variable, but each row between any two particular labels should have the same number of 1/0s (though might potentially not).How do I grab each name+rows chunk with a scanner?  Is there any elegant way to enforce the consistency on the number of rows (and provide some sort of feedback if they aren't consistent)?I'm thinking there might be a convenient way with clever delimiter specification, but I can't seem to get that working.
Java Scanner Delimiter Usage : I'd like to specify a delimiter for a scanner that splits on some pattern, but doesn't remove that pattern from the tokens.  I can't seem to make this work, as anything that is identified by the regex also gets eaten as part of the delimiter.  Any suggestions?My specific problem, I have file that looks like:text/numbers mixnumbersnumberstext/numbers mixnumbersnumbersnumbers..I'd like to split out from the text/numbers mix+rows until the next text/numbers mix.  I have the regex to identify them, but as stated, using that as the delimiter eats part of what I want.EDIT: code addition:static final String labelRegex=\\s*[^01\\s*]\\w+\\s*;static final Pattern labelPattern = Pattern.compile(labelRegex, Pattern.MULTILINE);is the pattern I used to identify the text/numbers bit (I know my numbers rows contain all 1/0s separated by spaces).When I initialize the scanner:stateScan = new Scanner(new BufferedReader(new FileReader(source)));stateScan.useDelimiter(labelPattern);that eats the labels, and just leaves the rows.  I currently have a working implementation that starts two scanners on two buffered file readers from the same source, one splitting by states and the other by labels.  I'd really like it to be just one grabbing label+state.
Calculating the difference between two Java date instances : I'm using Java's java.util.date class in Scala and want to compare a date object and the current time. I know I can calculate the delta by using getTime():(new java.util.Date()).getTime() - oldDate.getTime()However, this just leaves me with a Long representing milliseconds. Is there any simpler, nicer way to get a time delta?
Is it valid to sign a Java war file and include the MANIFEST.MF in /META-INF : I am looking to sign a war file for distribution via Java Web Start. As I understand it, the jar signer tool ignores the contents of the META-INF directory so that the signing process does not change the digest value of the jar file.Will this same process work for a war file? I've never used a META-INF directory in the root of a war file, and I'm not sure it is legal to do so. Even if it is, will this be accepted by the Webstart security manager as a properly signed file?Thanks in advance,Rob.
Java/ImageIO getting image dimensions without reading the entire file? : Is there a way to get the dimensions of an image without reading the entire file?URL url=new URL(BIG_IMAGE_URL);BufferedImage img=ImageIO.read(url);System.out.println(img.getWidth()+ +img.getHeight());img=null;
Java Web Start window title problem : I've written a JavaFX application that uses Java Web Start. For some reason, the window title is always Java (on Linux) or blank (on Windows). However, the desktop icon has the correct application title and image.  From what I've found so far, the important bit here is the information  title element in the JNLP file. What am I missing? NOTE: I'm happy to post my JNLP content if someone says it would be of use. 
How to set classpath when I use javax.tools.JavaCompiler compile the source? : I use the class javax.tools.JavaCompiler (jdk6) to compile a source file, but the source file depends on some jar file. How to set the classpath of the javax.tools.JavaCompiler?
unboxing using the ASM Java library : I'm using the ASM Java library to replace some reflection. I generate the body of this method:void set(Object object, int fieldIndex, Object value);With this generated method, I can set fields on an object at runtime without using reflection. It works great. However, I found it fails for primitive fields. Here is the relevant part of my set method:for (int i = 0, n = cachedFields.length; i  n; i++) {    mv.visitLabel(labels[i]);    mv.visitFrame(Opcodes.F_SAME, 0, null, 0, null);    mv.visitVarInsn(ALOAD, 1);    mv.visitTypeInsn(CHECKCAST, targetClassName);    mv.visitVarInsn(ALOAD, 3);    Field field = cachedFields[i].field;    Type fieldType = Type.getType(field.getType());    mv.visitFieldInsn(PUTFIELD, targetClassName, field.getName(), fieldType.getDescriptor());    mv.visitInsn(RETURN);}This code is generating case labels for a select. It works great for objects but for primitives I get this error:blockquote  Expecting to find float on stack/blockquoteOk, that makes sense, I need to do the unboxing myself. I implemented the following:for (int i = 0, n = cachedFields.length; i  n; i++) {    mv.visitLabel(labels[i]);    mv.visitFrame(Opcodes.F_SAME, 0, null, 0, null);    mv.visitVarInsn(ALOAD, 1);    mv.visitTypeInsn(CHECKCAST, targetClassName);    mv.visitVarInsn(ALOAD, 3);    Field field = cachedFields[i].field;    Type fieldType = Type.getType(field.getType());    switch (fieldType.getSort()) {    case Type.BOOLEAN:        mv.visitTypeInsn(CHECKCAST, java/lang/Boolean);        mv.visitMethodInsn(INVOKEVIRTUAL, java/lang/Boolean, booleanValue, ()Z);        break;    case Type.BYTE:        mv.visitTypeInsn(CHECKCAST, java/lang/Byte);        mv.visitMethodInsn(INVOKEVIRTUAL, java/lang/Byte, byteValue, ()B);        break;    case Type.CHAR:        mv.visitTypeInsn(CHECKCAST, java/lang/Character);        mv.visitMethodInsn(INVOKEVIRTUAL, java/lang/Character, charValue, ()C);        break;    case Type.SHORT:        mv.visitTypeInsn(CHECKCAST, java/lang/Short);        mv.visitMethodInsn(INVOKEVIRTUAL, java/lang/Short, shortValue, ()S);        break;    case Type.INT:        mv.visitTypeInsn(CHECKCAST, java/lang/Integer);        mv.visitMethodInsn(INVOKEVIRTUAL, java/lang/Integer, intValue, ()I);        break;    case Type.FLOAT:        mv.visitTypeInsn(CHECKCAST, java/lang/Float);        mv.visitMethodInsn(INVOKEVIRTUAL, java/lang/Float, floatValue, ()F);        break;    case Type.LONG:        mv.visitTypeInsn(CHECKCAST, java/lang/Long);        mv.visitMethodInsn(INVOKEVIRTUAL, java/lang/Long, longValue, ()J);        break;    case Type.DOUBLE:        mv.visitTypeInsn(CHECKCAST, java/lang/Double);        mv.visitMethodInsn(INVOKEVIRTUAL, java/lang/Double, doubleValue, ()D);        break;    case Type.ARRAY:        mv.visitTypeInsn(CHECKCAST, fieldType.getDescriptor());        break;    case Type.OBJECT:        mv.visitTypeInsn(CHECKCAST, fieldType.getInternalName());        break;    }    mv.visitFieldInsn(PUTFIELD, targetClassName, field.getName(), fieldType.getDescriptor());    mv.visitInsn(RETURN);}I have traced through and it definitely goes into case Type.FLOAT for the appropriate field, however, I get this error:blockquote  Expecting to find object/array on stack/blockquoteThis is where I'm stuck. For the life of me I can't figure out why the unboxing doesn't work. The ALOAD, 3 is putting the third parameter of the set method on the stack, which should be a Float. Any ideas?I found the asm-commons library has a GeneratorAdapter class that has an unbox method. However, I don't really want to include yet another JAR for something that should be so simple. I looked at the GeneratorAdapter source and it is doing something very similar. I tried to modify my code to use GeneratorAdapter, just to see if it worked, but didn't find it at all easy to convert.
Setting the from name in a javax.mail.MimeMessage? : Currently, our application uses a javax.mail to send email, using javax.mail.MailMessage. We set the From headers of the email this way:Message msg = new MimeMessage(mailSession);msg.setFrom(new InternetAddress(mail@companyxyz.com));This works just fine, but we'd like to make the From section a little more user-friendly. Currently, someone receiving an email will see mail@companyxyz.com in the From section of their inbox. Instead, we'd like them to see Company XYZ there. I figure this is probably done with the addHeader() method, but I'm not sure what the header name would be. 
Java Web Start: How to write files to windows UNC Path? : I have an Java application for copying large amounts of data from users' workstations to a server. The java.io.File class is supposed to work with UNC paths very well and in fact it does but only when I run the app in standard execution model.When the application is launched via Web Start I get a FileNotFoundException when trying to open a FileOutputStream with The network path was not found in message. Again everything works fine when I download the jar to the PC and lauch it from command line.My app is signed and i define all-permissions in JNLP.Edit: I have also discovered that when I map the UNC path to a drive letter it works too.
Compiling a set of Java files inside a directory tree with the JSR 199 Compiler API : I'm trying to compile many files using the Compiler API.Say I have a directory structureblockquote.../program   +/org    +/foo    |+ Main.java    +/bar     + Tools.java/blockquoteIs there any way to discover all the Java files and make it compiler everything without resorting to recursing into all the directories and finding all the *.java files?EDIT: What I'm trying to do is compile all the classes that I get in some directory tree. These classes are independent of each other. Then I load the classes and instantiate some objects of these classes and call methods. None of the classes need to have main.
Automation server can't create object - Microsoft JScript runtime error : I am trying to run a Java webstart application which is launched from a html page. While loading I get an alert with the message Automation server can't create object a couple of times after which the applications starts and works fine. The alerts come up only on one of the workstations. Any pointers on where I should look?Regards,Dutch
WSContext.getUserPrincipal() returns null for password digest authentication : In my WebService I need to log the caller's id, but wsContext.getUserPrincipal() returns null even though the user was authenticated using WS-Security with password authentication.  According to the JavaDocs for JAX-WS 2.1 WSContext.getUserPrincipal() should only return null if the user has not been authenticated.Do I have to do something in the security handler to set the user principal into the WSContext? The docs seem to indicate that it is done automatically.I'm using the metro 1.1 stack (1.1.5 I think) with jax-ws 2.1.3 stack on Tomcat.
How to read pixel color in a java BufferedImage with transparency : I am reading pixel color in a BufferedImage as follows:.....InputStream is = new BufferedInputStream(conn.getInputStream());BufferedImage image = ImageIO.read(is);int color = image.getRGB(x, y);int  red = (colour amp; 0x00ff0000)  16;int  green = (colour amp; 0x0000ff00)  8;int  blue = colour amp; 0x000000ff;Now this works fine except for png's with transparency. I find that if x,y refer to a transparent pixel with no color, i still read a color, generally the same color as used elsewhere in the image.How do I detect that the pixel is actually transparent and not colored?Thanks

SWT and Webstart on Mac : I'm trying to develop a UI using SWT and Java Webstart. As a starting point I've created a simple app that works fine with Windows and Linux, but fails to work on Mac. My test app is available a href=http://www.bcfantasy.com/webstart rel=nofollow noreferrerhere. There are also links to the jar files and class code. Can anyone explain how to make this work on Mac?
Comparison between Sun Metro and Apache CXF for webservices development? : What are the relative strengths and weaknesses between Sun Metro and Apache CXF for webservice development in Java. Is there another framework that I should be looking at as well?
New Java applet plugin not being used? : I am deploying a signed amp; trusted applet. We need to run the applet in a separate JVM amp; increase the heap size. Setting separate_jvm amp; java_arguments works on our local boxes. Curiously we have clients that though they are using 1.6.0_15 don't seem to be running the new plugin architecture. When I check their Java config, use next-generation plugin is checked amp; IE7's option use Java 1.6.0_15 for applet plugin is also checked. Nothing seems obviously wrong. The Java console also reports the correct version, but neither separate_jvm nor java_arguments are respected.Just as a sanity check we wrapped the applet in a JNLP amp; set up our web page to serve the applet with a jnlp_href. The applet tag had a bogus code parameter to ensure the JVM was actually running the JNLP. The Java console complains that it cannot find the bogus class when it should be properly loading the JNLP.Are there security settings or something else that might cause what I'm seeing?

Clojure: working with a java.util.HashMap in an idomatic Clojure fashion : I have a java.util.HashMap object m (a return value from a call to Java code) and I'd like to get a new map with an additional key-value pair.If m were a Clojure map, I could use:(assoc m key value)But trying that on a HashMap gives:java.lang.ClassCastException: java.util.HashMap cannot be cast to clojure.lang.AssociativeNo luck with seq either:(assoc (seq m) key value)java.lang.ClassCastException: clojure.lang.IteratorSeq cannot be cast to clojure.lang.AssociativeThe only way I managed to do it was to use HashMap's own put, but that returns void so I have to explicitly return m:(do (. m put key value) m)This is not idiomatic Clojure code, plus I'm modifying m instead of creating a new map.Any ideas on how to work with a HashMap in a more Clojure-ish way?
Importing from Text File Java question : I decided to create a currency converter in Java, and have it so that it would pull the conversion values out of a text file (to allow for easy editability since these values are constantly changing). I did manage to do it by using the Scanner class and putting all the values into an ArrayList.Now I'm wondering if there is a way to add comments to the text file for the user to read, which Scanner will ignore. // doesn't seem to work.Thanks
Either WSDL or wsimport and wsdl (mono) are horribly broken : EDIT I started off with the example given below, but I have now:Tried the example from the W3C spec. After fixing another error (binding was called StockQuoteSoapBinding in one place, StockQuoteBinding in another), it gives the same issue.Tried the mono generator wsdl to see if wsimport was to blame. It gives an equivalent error.So it seems to me that despite all the hype about SOAP, it doesn't actually work - at least not as advertised.

What are the impacts of setting establishSecurityContext=False if i use https? : My WFC service uses wsHttpBinding configured with:security mode=TransportWithMessageCredential    message establishSecurityContext=True clientCredentialType=UserName/    transport clientCredentialType=None proxyCredentialType=None//securityOne of our partner is trying to invoke our services using the java the Metro library.

I have to set establishSecurityContext=False for this to work. We did a quick test and it works indeed when I set it to false. What would be the impacts of not using secure sessions (by setting establishSecurityContext=False). I'm already running on https. So will I be OK in terms of security? And are there other impacts to consider (performance maybe)?Thanks

jnlp webstart nativelib: how to specify different architecture for os : in a java webstart file (jnlp) you can specify the nativelib tag to load binaries. you can also specify toload different ones for different operating systems by also specifying the os attribute.for example:resources os=Linux    nativelib href=....jar//resourcesresources os=Windows    nativelib href=....jar//resourcesresources os=Mac OS X    nativelib href=....jar/ /resourcesbut how can i specify even different binaries for different architectures? for example win32 and win64 or linux 32 and linux 64bit. operating systems. where can i find a list of options for the os-attribute?
Does javax.tools depend on the JDK? : I want to use JavaCompiler to dynamically create some classes. I found the source code of the javax.tools package, but there is no implementation; some posts on the internet say it depends on tools.jar, I am not sure tools.jar associates with JRE.So, can I run the program in a JRE environment without JDK installed?Another question, what is the implementation detail of JavaCompiler, is it creating a new process to invoke the javac command?thanks

How to validate Java logging properties files? : I have a basic facility for allowing users to remotely apply changes to the logging files in my application.  Some logs are configured using java.util.logging properties files, and some are configured using log4j/log4cplus-style properties files.  I'd like to do some basic validation of the properties that users try to apply.  Namely, I want to assure the following:Every logging.properties file must always contain at least a root logger/logging levelThe logger/level must be set to a valid value.  That is, they should not be able to set .level = GIBBERISH or anything like that.I'll probably allow them to set MaxFileSize and MaxBackupIndex (log4j), and .limit and .count properties (java.util.logging), too.What's the best way to accomplish this?  I can obviously just loop over the keys and values in a Properties object and look for their values in a hard-coded Map or some other data structure that tells what valid properties are, but I'm trying to come up with a solution that's a little more elegant than that.
how to catch blank input with scanner class in java : I am using the scanner class to capture user input from the command line (strings only), as an alternative to my previous a href=http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1737611/proper-way-to-read-user-input-from-command-line-in-javaquestion.The following seems to work fine, except the blank lines are not caught as they should by the second conditional. For example when I press enter, this should be captured as a blank line and the second conditional should be true. However a new blank line is displayed on the console everytime, with the entire console scrolling upward if I keep hitting enter, rather than the logic in the conditional.Is there a proper way to catch a blank input from the command line using scanner? (someone hitting just enter, or hit space a few times and then enter) Thank you for any adviceMachine aMachine = new Machine();String select;Scanner br = new Scanner(System.in);  while(aMachine.stillInUse()){  select = br.next();        if (Pattern.matches([rqRQ1-6], select.trim())) {        aMachine.getCommand(select.trim().toUpperCase()).execute(aMachine);        }        /*         * Ignore blank input lines and simply         * redisplay current status -- Scanner doesn't catch this         */        else if(select.trim().isEmpty()){        aMachine.getStatus();        /*         * Everything else is treated         * as an invalid command         */    else {                            System.out.println(aMachine.badCommand()+select);            aMachine.getStatus();        }    }
Webservice security : I have exposed one web service (Service Interface to access my application), What are the different ways to create/implement web service security?  Could anyone please suggest some idea?
How to hide interface methods in the web service when using @WebService's `endpointInterface` attribute? : Is there a way to prevent a method from an interface used in @WebService's endpointInterface attribute to be exposed in the web service? I'm using the endpointInterface as that seems to be the only way to make the service work on JBoss with Metro, not doing so results in a:javax.xml.ws.WebServiceException: Undefined port type
java.util.concurrent vs. Boost Threads library : How do the Boost Thread libraries compare against the java.util.concurrent libraries?Performance is critical and so I would prefer to stay with C++ (although Java is a lot faster these days). Given that I have to code in C++, what libraries exist to make threading easy and less error prone. I have heard recently that as of JDK 1.5, the Java memory model was changed to fix some concurrency issues. How about C++? The last time I did multithreaded programming in C++ was 3-4 years ago when I used pthreads. Although, I don't wish to use that anymore for a large project. The only other alternative that I know of is Boost Threads. However, I am not sure if it is good. I've heard good things about java.util.concurrent, but nothing yet about Boost threads.
Looping Forever : I'm trying to loop an exception, but for some reason its not giving me the option to re write my scanner file:I don't know how to use BufferedReader so that's why I'm using this.  Any clues?Here's my standard class with my methodpackage arrayExceptionsWithInput;import java.util.*;public class GetThoseNumbersBaby {    int firstInt;    int secondInt;    boolean error;    Scanner yourNumbers = new Scanner(System.in);    public void findNumbers()    {        System.out.println( please enter your first number);        firstInt = yourNumbers.nextInt();        System.out.println( pleas enter your second number);        secondInt = yourNumbers.nextInt();        int finalInt = (firstInt+secondInt);        System.out.println(total is:  + finalInt);    }}And here's my main class with the exception being implemeted with a loop:package arrayExceptionsWithInput;import java.util.*;public class InputException{    public static void main(String[] args)    {        boolean error = false;        GetThoseNumbersBaby zack = new  GetThoseNumbersBaby();        {            do {                try                {                    zack.findNumbers();                }                catch(InputMismatchException Q)                {                    System.out.println( one of your integers was incorrect, please try again);                    Q.printStackTrace();                    error = true;                }             } while (error == true);        }        error = false;    }}If anyone has any ideas on how to loop this differently I'm all ears.
java wrapper around log4j logger and java.util.logging : I am writing a library. The library can be used by applications that use log4j loggers and java.util.logging loggers.So, I wrote a quick wrapper class, that encapsulates both loggers. I allow the application to set one or both loggers. And in my library I use the encapsulated class to print to either logger.My question is, since many threads can simultaneously be using the same instance of the wrapper class to log messages using the class' methods (for example: fatal() below), what steps should be taken to make these methods thread safe?public class MultiLogger {    private static org.apache.log4j.Logger _log4jLogger = null;    private static java.util.logging.Logger _javaUtilLogger = null;    private MultiLogger () {    }    // log4j FATAL, log util SEVERE    public void fatal (Object message) {        if (_log4jLogger != null) {            _log4jLogger.log(, Level.FATAL, message, null);        }        if (_javaUtilLogger != null) {            _javaUtilLogger.severe((String) message);        }    }    ...}Any other comments appreciated too.
Java: .class file and java.lang.Class : Is java.lang.Class the same as the actual .class file? i.e. is the content equivalent?I want to send the .class over socket, and was wondering if instead of trying to find and load the actual .class file, if I could just transmit the java.lang.Class instead?Elaboration (read if you want more info)Suppose I have a Java class called SomeObj. When this file is compiled, a file called SomeObj.class will be generated.We also know that if I have SomeObj as a type, we could get its java.lang.Class type by doing:Class someObjClss = SomeObj.class;We know java.lang.Class implements Serializable, thus it can be transmitted.So is java.lang.Class basically the object representation of the actual .class file?UPDATE:Assuming I have transmitted the .class file over to another host, do I just use the defineClass() method to construct the class back?Link a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/ClassLoader.html rel=nofollow noreferrerhereUPDATE2:This code does returns null InputStream. How is that possible?Class clazz = String.class;String className = clazz.getName(); System.out.println(className);URL url = clazz.getResource(className);if( url != null ){  String pathName = url.getPath(); System.out.println(className);}InputStream inputStream = clazz.getResourceAsStream(className);if(inputStream != null ){  System.out.println(inputStream.available());}
How to deploy Java Communications API : I've been developing a java application with the eclipse RCP which requires the Java Communications API. Now as the javax.comm has to be setup first (install javax.comm.properties, win32comm.dll and comm.jar) my question ist: How should I deploy my application to make sure javax.comm will be setup on the user's machine? Should I provide an installer which does the setup or should I let the application itself export the files in their respective directories?I have never before done such a thing, so I'd appreciate any help.Thanks
Javax.mail in JNLP : I have a problem with my program. I develop in Netbeans, and when i run the program it is working fine. i built it, created a *.jar file, and updatet it in my JNLP file.here comes the trouble. as i'm using javax.mail.* in my program, the jnlp package just ignores all parts of it. Just to be clear, i'm working on a mail client. now i can check the numbers of the mails in the inbox. that is what the program ignores in JNLP.Thanks for any help.
What can I do to make jar / classes smaller? : I'm developing a Java Applet, and reducing the size of the binary code will make the applet open faster and will improve the user experience.Is there anything I can do to reduce the size of classes and / or jar files? I want to be sure I'm not missing obvious tricks.I know that in the C++ world compiler options for e.g. stripping debug symbols can make a huge difference, but I've never seen something like that for Java.
Casting objects in JRuby : Is there a way I can explicitly cast one Java object to another Java class from JRuby?  Sometimes I want to be able to invoke SomeJavaClass#aMethod(MySuperClass) rather than SomeJavaClass#aMethod(MyClass) from JRuby.  From Java, I'd do this:someJavaObject.aMethod( (MySuperClass) myObj );but I didn't see a #cast ruby method or anything like that to do the equivalent from JRuby.Note that the question a href=http://stackoverflow.com/questions/548565/casting-java-objects-from-jrubyCasting Java Objects From JRuby lacks an answer for the general case, which is why I'm re-asking the question.
Using a Java library with Scala reserved words : I'm using an external library written in Java (a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_%28software%29 rel=nofollow noreferrerSelenium). One of the function calls has the signature type(String, String), and I keep getting compiler errors when trying to call it from Scala, that is:selenium.type(ab,abc)Is there a workaround for this issue?
Java: Infinite loop using Scanner in.hasNextInt() : I am using the following code:while (invalidInput){    // ask the user to specify a number to update the times by    System.out.print(Specify an integer between 0 and 5: );    if (in.hasNextInt())    {        // get the update value        updateValue = in.nextInt();        // check to see if it was within range        if (updateValue = 0 amp;amp; updateValue = 5)         {             invalidInput = false;         }         else         {            System.out.println(You have not entered a number between 0 and 5. Try again.);        }    } else    {        System.out.println(You have entered an invalid input. Try again.);    }}However, if I enter a 'w' it will tell me You have entered invalid input. Try Again. and then it will go into an infinite loop showing the text Specify an integer between 0 and 5: You have entered an invalid input. Try again.Why is this happening? Isn't the program supposed to wait for the user to input and press enter each time it reaches the statement:if (in.hasNextInt())
ASM jar - Why my java project has a dependency on this? : I have a Java project and internally it is dependent on asm jar. Strangely, I don't even know why my project somehow is dependent on this library (might be brought in by maven as a transitive dependency)?Can anyone help me know why some one needs asm jar?Thanks in advance !EDIT:Can you also mention for what purposes/use-cases one might need asm jar?
How to suppress the keystore password prompt when using Java Webstart with client auth? : Is there a way to suppress the password prompt when using Java Webstart with a https server that uses client authentication? I would like to do this, because the webstarted app runs on a touch screen device that got no keyboard and runs in a kiosk mode. Therefore it would be sufficient to either remove the password from the keystore or to store it somewhere, maybe in the desktop shortcut that starts the app.I already tried to attach a JVM Parameter to the shortcut like this, but it doesn't work:javaws -J-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=mypass https://...I also found out, when I activate the use browser keystore-option in the Java Control Panel and add the certificate to it, I can cancel the password prompt and still connect successfully. It seems like only the Java-Keystore asks for a password and Internet-Explorer's doesn't.
Why doesn't this for-loop let me input text the first cycle? : What I want to do is ask the user for a number of strings to read into an array, and then ask the user to input that number of strings and read them into the array. When I run this code it never asks me for an input the first cycle of the first for-loop, just prints out String #0: String #1:  and then I can input text. Why is that and what did I do wrong?import java.util.Scanner;public class ovn9 {public static void main(String[] args){    Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);    System.out.print(Number of inputs: );    int lines= sc.nextInt();    String[] text=new String[lines];    for(int x=0; xtext.length; x++)    {        System.out.print(String #+x+: );        text[x] = sc.nextLine();    }    for(int y=0; ytext.length; y++)        System.out.println(text[y]);}}

Copying only non-existent files in ant : I'm deploying my project to a web-server to be deployed with java Web Start. However, Web Start uses modification date to figure out whether to download the resources again (by default).What I want is a way to only deploy those (jar) files that do not already exist. This is made possible by having build-version numbers on all my jars, so 2 jars with the same name have the same contents.Notes:The jar modification dates will always be newer in the build (which is why I'm getting this problem), due to downloading from svn or ivyThere's a way to do this using sun's download servlet, more files etc, but I'm lazy, don't need it, and this (simpler) solution will be more robust in the long term
Java server-client | server wont receive second request : I'm trying to write a client and time server for an assignment and I'm having trouble getting the server to receive the second request from the client.

Problem converting PNG to JPG using Java (ImageIO.write()) : I am using ImageIO.write() to convert PNG files to JPG.  For some reason, my result image has a pink layer over it.  I have searched far and wide for a solution but haven't found any.  The code works for all other types of images except PNG.

Java compiled with gcj using javax.comm api. Possible? : I have a java program that I'm required to compile into a Linux native program using gcj-4.3.  This program requires serial port access.  The javax.comm api provides serial port access but I'm not sure how to get my compiled java program to use it.The target box has Java installed, but of course my compiled program isn't running in the JRE...so I'm not exactly sure how I can link in the comm.jar file or how that file can find the .properties file it requires.I wonder if I can just compile the comm.jar allong with my .jar file and link the two object files together.  Can my code then reference the classes in comm.jar?  Thanks in advance for your help!
Is there an easy way to reduce the number of colors in an IndexedColorModel? : I have a large 8-bit PNG image.  I am using Java to slice the image into smaller 32x32 images.  I use Java's ImageIO to load the PNG into a BufferedImage and then call it's getSubimage(x, y, 32, 32).  I then use ImageIO to write each tile out as a PNG.The problem is that the resulting image has the same IndexColorModel as the original image.  For example, one 32x32 tile has only 8 total colors but it includes a color model with all 100-odd colors from the original image.I would like to remove unused colors from the 32x32 tile's IndexColorModel before I write out the PNG.  There is no sense including color data for colors not used in the image and I'd like the images to be as small as possible.Is there a built-in mechanism to do this or can someone point me to an (easy) way to modify/reduce the ColorModel?Thanks!

signing jars to be used over web start : I have a java web start app that uses Swing and needs to allow a user to open a file local on their machine. My application is failing to run because it says that the the single jar I am trying to use is unsigned. I did however, sign it.In my .jnlp file I am specifying security as:security    j2ee-application-client-permissions//securityand I used the following commands to create the keystoare sign my jar file, validator.jar:keytool -genkey -keystore mykeys -alias https://www.mydomain.comjarsigner -keystore mykeys -storetype JKS validator.jar https://www.mydomain.comAny ideas?Thanks!

I am attempting to get FileContents like so:FileContents fileContents = fileOpenService.openFileDialog(null, null);I never see a dialog, and fileContents is always null.Thanks!
Memory effects of synchronization in Java : a href=http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/pugh/java/memoryModel/jsr-133-faq.html#synchronization rel=nofollow noreferrerJSR-133 FAQ says:blockquote  But there is more to synchronization  than mutual exclusion. Synchronization  ensures that memory writes by a thread  before or during a synchronized block  are made visible in a predictable  manner to other threads which  synchronize on the same monitor. After  we exit a synchronized block, we  release the monitor, which has the  effect of flushing the cache to main  memory, so that writes made by this  thread can be visible to other  threads. Before we can enter a  synchronized block, we acquire the  monitor, which has the effect of  invalidating the local processor cache  so that variables will be reloaded  from main memory. We will then be able  to see all of the writes made visible  by the previous release./blockquoteI also remember reading that on modern Sun VMs uncontended synchronizations are cheap. I am a little confused by this claim. Consider code like:class Foo {    int x = 1;    int y = 1;    ..    synchronized (aLock) {        x = x + 1;    }}Updates to x need the synchronization, but does the acquisition of the lock clear the value of y also from the cache? I can't imagine that to be the case, because if it were true,   techniques like lock striping might not help. Alternatively can the JVM reliably analyze the code to ensure that y is not modified in another synchronized block using the same lock and hence not dump the value of y in cache when entering the synchronized block?
How to inspect the stack using an ASM visitor? : I am attempting to use the Java byte code engineering library a href=http://asm.ow2.org/index.html rel=nofollow noreferrerASM to perform static analysis. I have the situation where I would like to inspect the variables being assigned to a field.I have MethodVisitor which implements the visitFieldInsn() method. I am specifically looking for the putfield command. That is no problem. The problem is that when I encounter putfield, I want to be able to access the variable that's going to be assigned to the field. Specifically I want to access information about the type of the variable.At the moment I really only need to look at what's at the top of the stack, but if there's a more general way to inspect it that's even better.Is there a way using ASM to inspect the variables on the stack? 
Event Dispatch Thread meets the Java Memory Model : This is related to an earlier a href=http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1621495/if-more-than-one-thread-can-access-a-field-should-it-be-marked-as-volatilequestion I asked, where the answer was:blockquote  If a field is accessed by multiple  threads, it should be volatile or  final, or accessed only with  synchronized blocks. Otherwise,  assigned values may not be visible to  other threads./blockquoteIn addition anything that manipulates pixels on screen should be run from the a href=http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/dispatch.html rel=nofollow noreferrerevent dispatch thread although this is handled transparently when you use repaint / paint.Therefore, by my understanding, we need worry about the memory model for something as simple as an animation of a sprite moving across the screen.My question is, is this understanding correct, and Sun tutorial examples eg a href=http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/components/applet.html rel=nofollow noreferrerTumbleItem (a href=http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/examples/components/TumbleItemProject/src/components/TumbleItem.java rel=nofollow noreferrersource) incorrect?
threading issues with java swing and web start : EDIT: After fixing a few issues, the bigger issue that I am having is being caused by Apache POI which I am using. I am working on figuring that out now. Apparently it is being restricted by the Sandbox.I'm very new to Swing, and created a small Swing app that I now need to have run via web start. I'm trying to use the FileOpenService and update a Text display. I think I am running into threading issues, because the FileOpenService dialog never appears, and my text display is not getting updated. I can't really find any examples where they are doing anything different than I am right now.Ideas?Thanks!Edit: I now have the FileOpenService dialog appearing. I changed my main to this:public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {    javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {        public void run() {            new MainFrame();        }    });}However, I still can't get my display to update. This is where I am doing the update: Runnable r = new Runnable() {        public void run() {            for (final String s : Logger.getMessages())                append(s + \n);        }    };    try {        if (SwingUtilities.isEventDispatchThread())            r.run();        else            SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait(r);    } and my append method:private void append(Color c, String s) {// throws Exception {    StyleContext sc = StyleContext.getDefaultStyleContext();    AttributeSet aset = sc.addAttribute(SimpleAttributeSet.EMPTY,            StyleConstants.Foreground, c);    int len = _textPaneLog.getDocument().getLength();    try {        _textPaneLog.getDocument().insertString(len, s, aset);    } catch (BadLocationException e) {        e.printStackTrace();    }}

Is there a mono (.Net) equivalent to the Scanner-class in Java : In Java there is a nice class called Scanner for reading strings and streams of a certain format to data-structures like integers, floats,... Is there any equivalent in Mono? In .Net there is a binary-reader, but it reads the data as binaries. I want a class that read the data by parsing it from a string.EDIT: reaction on the current answers, I know most of the data-types have a parse-method, but the problem with these are, they don't read the string sequentially. In Java you simply initialize the object, and by activating methods, you sequentially read the data-types.

Metro + Jetty + OSGi = pain : I am trying to swap out Sun's HTTPServer for the much better Jetty server, within an OSGi bundle, running on Equinox.I have tried this:System.setProperty(com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServerProvider,org.mortbay.jetty.j2se6.JettyHttpServerProvider);but when endpoint.publish(url) is called, and the server is spawned, it complains of a ClassNotFoundException for org.mortbay.jetty.j2se6.JettyHttpServerProvider.However, the correct jars are in the bundle, and indeed in the Activator I can instantiate a org.mortbay.jetty.j2se6.JettyHttpServerProvider. I think that this is a some kind of classpath issue - the spawned server is in a different classpath maybe? I have tried adding the JARs in at the JDK level, but this doesn't make any difference.Can oanyone shed any light how on earth to get this working?P.S. Maybe hideous System.setProperty calls will vanish from the world one day. Hopefully :)

I am not able launch JNLP applications using Java Web Start? : Up until recently, I was able to launch/open JNLP files in Firefox using Java web start.Don't know what happened all of a sudden JNLP files stopped launching, a splash screen appears saying Java Starting... and then nothing happens. Even the Java Console in the browser and javacpl.cpl applet doesn't open.Tried all possibilities: removed all older version and installed the latest JRE (java version 1.6.0_17), still it doesn't work.Done some googling for this problem, people suggested to start javaws.exe with -viewer option but same behavior (a splash screen appears saying Java Starting... and then disappears)The problem is that I don't know any place (logs etc.) to look for to see what is causing the problem.I am using WinXP SP3, and some of the screenshots below shows further info about my system. I can provide any other detail if required but please help me solve this problem.
Problem consuming Exchange Web Service 2010 with jax-ws metro : I am trying to consume the Exchange 2010 Web Service interface using JAX-WS. I'm using JAX-WS 2.2 RI (Metro 2.0). 2.1 exhibited the same problem.I am running into trouble with Exchange, which returns HTTP/1.1 415 Cannot process the message because the content type 'text/xml;charset=utf-8' was not the expected type 'text/xml; charset=utf-8'. as a reponse (2.1 quoted the charset value, otherwise same response).Apparently I need to dictate the exact Content-type header for Exchange to be happy.Is there a way for me to do this without forcing me to manually rebuild the dependency? I currently rely on published maven artifacts, and would like to continue doing this if at all possible.The consuming process is a regular J2SE app, with no containers in sight. I have control of the application and can add pretty much anything required to the applications scope, but can not add out-of-process items like proxy servers. The client classes were generated from local WSDL, but the charset specification is derived from constants declared in the jaxws RI implementation, not the generated code. The resulting HTTP transport is thus handled by the standard http/https client from Sun JRE5 or JRE6.
IMAP - javax.mail. - Fetching Only Body Without Attachment : I am trying to develop an IMAP email client using the javax.mail API. I have been able to contact the servers, fetch emails, attachments and other operations without any problem.However, we would not want to fetch the attachment until the user wants to view it explit in order to improve the performance. This would mean that we would need information  which would indicate if the email has an attachment, if yes, then the filename(s) and the size(s)but would not send me the actual content of the email. However, I was not able to find a method in the API description which would return just the multi-part content. Is there a way I could fetch just the body and the details of the attachment but not the actual attachment?Thanks,Aravind
Does ImageIO read imply anti-aliased scaling? : I've replaced the Java internal ImageFetcher with an own implementation using ImageIO. Some image renderers of our software, which use these images, now draw anti-aliased scaled images instead of non anti-aliased. The only change is the source of the image, which are now BufferedImages instead of Toolkit-Images.The question now is, where is the difference? Which property causes the images to scale anti-aliased? I've always thought that the anti-alias key ONLY depends on the graphics I paint on - but this is obviously wrong.By the way: unfortunately I cannot change the renderers.

Using CXF web service from java web start : UPDATE: I have submitted my question to the CXF User's mailing list, here.UPDATE: I have currently signed all of my jars. I still can't seem to get CXF setup in a way that it can find the WSDL. My last attempt was to place the WSDL inside of my WAr file so I can access it through a web browser. I set the wsdllocation inside of the client to the URL (a href=http://www.example.com/app/example.wsdl rel=nofollow noreferrerhttp://www.example.com/app/example.wsdl). I am now getting the following exception:Exception in thread AWT-EventQueue-0 java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerErrorat com.sun.xml.internal.ws.util.xml.XmlUtil.createDefaultCatalogResolver(Unknown Source)at com.sun.xml.internal.ws.client.WSServiceDelegate.parseWSDL(Unknown Source)at com.sun.xml.internal.ws.client.WSServiceDelegate.init(Unknown Source)at com.sun.xml.internal.ws.client.WSServiceDelegate.init(Unknown Source)at com.sun.xml.internal.ws.spi.ProviderImpl.createServiceDelegate(Unknown Source)at javax.xml.ws.Service.init(Unknown Source)Googling has turned up pretty much nothing on this.I am creating a web service client from a given WSDL using a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_CXF rel=nofollow noreferrerApache CXF.

The a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language rel=nofollow noreferrerWSDL mentioned is packaged within my jar. The problem is caused by this from the CXF generated client code:    URL url = null;    try {        url = new URL(../resource/example.wsdl);    } catch (MalformedURLException e) {        System.err.println(Can not initialize the default wsdl from ../resource/example.wsdl);        // e.printStackTrace();    }    WSDL_LOCATION = url;How can I correctly point CXF to this WSDL? I am also worried about the WebService annotation on the class:@WebServiceClient(name = Example,               wsdlLocation = ../resource/example.wsdl,              targetNamespace = http://services.example.com/) Do I also need to change this?

Is it possible to customize the namespace prefix that JAXB uses when marshalling to a String? : For example, I've got a simple schema which imports another schema.  The second schema (urn:just:attributes, just-attributes.xsd) just defines an attribute group.?xml version=1.0 encoding=UTF-8?schema xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema     targetNamespace=http://www.example.org/MySchema    xmlns:tns=http://www.example.org/MySchema     elementFormDefault=qualified    xmlns:ja=urn:just:attributes    import schemaLocation=just-attributes.xsd namespace=urn:just:attributes/    element name=MyElement        complexType            attributeGroup ref=ja:AttributeGroup/        /complexType    /element/schemaI'm using the Metro xjc Ant task to generate classes off of this schema.  The problem I'm running into is that the third party application I'm interacting with is peculiar about namespaces.  This case I need a String value, so I have to serialize it.  I use boilerplate code for this.private static T String marshal(T object) throws JAXBException{    OutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();    JAXBContext jaxbContext = JAXBContext.newInstance(object.getClass());    Marshaller marshaller = jaxbContext.createMarshaller();    marshaller.marshal(object, outputStream);    return outputStream.toString();}Which gives me something along the lines of?xml version=1.0 encoding=UTF-8 standalone=yes?ns2:MyElement xmlns:ns1=urn:just:attributes xmlns:ns2=http://www.example.org/MySchema ns1:attrib1=1234 ns1:attrib2=5678/The problem I have is that this third party expects something like xmlns:thirdpartyns=urn:just:attributes, which is to say, they are parsing based on the name given to the namespace.  It has to be thirdpartyns for their software to work.Does anyone know of a way around this, short of doing a find and replace in the resulting string?  A custom binding rule perhaps?
Does Clojure have an equivalent of Java's import package.*? : Or do I have to specifically enumerate every class that I import?  I'm just learning Clojure now, and it seems useful to be able to do something like this in the REPL:(import '(java.io *))Not that this is valid syntax, but it would be nice to have something that does the equivalent.  It would save some typing, especially when tinkering around.  In actual production code I always enumerate each class that I'm importing, regardless of the language, but it's pretty convenient not to have to do so.

Determine classes used by a Java application : How would you determine the classes (non Sun JDK classes) loaded /  unused by a Java application?Background:I have an legacy Java webstart application that has gone through a lot of code changes and now has a lot of classes, most of which are not used. I would like to reduce the download size of the application by only deploying classes that will be used only instead of jaring the all the packages.I will also use the same process to completely delete these unused classes.
How to scan a file in a different directory in java? : How do you scan a file with java that isn't in the directory the java file is in?For example: The java file is located at C:\Files\JavaFiles\test.java However, the file I want to scan is located at C:\Data\DataPacket99\data.txtNote: I've already tried putting another java file in the C:\Data directory and using the test.java file as a class, but it doesn't work. It still tries to scan from the C:\Files\JavaFiles Directory.

Getting a Scala Map from a Java Properties : I was trying to pull environment variables into a scala script using java Iterators and / or Enumerations and realised that Dr Frankenstein might claim parentage, so I hacked the following from the ugly tree instead:import java.util.Map.Entryimport System._val propSet = getProperties().entrySet().toArray()val props   = (0 until propSet.size).foldLeft(Map[String, String]()){(m, i) =  val e = propSet(i).asInstanceOf[Entry[String, String]]  m + (e.getKey() - e.getValue())}For example to print the said same environmentprops.keySet.toList.sortWith(_  _).foreach{k =  println(k+(  * (30 - k.length))+ = +props(k))}Please, please don't set about polishing this t$#d, just show me the scala gem that I'm convinced exists for this situation (i.e java Properties -- scala.Map), thanks in advance ;@)

Java casting / classloader issues : Here is the simplified version of the problem: SomeClass c = (SomeClass) obj.getSomeClassParent()not always but it happens sometimes to trigger exception  org.somepackage.SomeClass can't be cast to org.somepackage.SomeClass How  is this possible ?  I suppose it has something to do with the fact that JAI imageio is   native lib, but relay how can this happen ? I'm probably missing something but what ? I'm using JAI imageio version 1.1 dcm4che 2.0.21  DICOM libHere is the original code  ImageInputStream iis = ImageIO.createImageInputStream(src);  IteratorImageReader iter = ImageIO.getImageReadersByFormatName(DICOM);  ImageReader reader = iter.next();  DicomImageReadParam param = (DicomImageReadParam) reader.getDefaultReadParam();And the original exceptionorg.dcm4che2.imageio.plugins.dcm.DicomImageReadParam can't be cast to    org.dcm4che2.imageio.plugins.dcm.DicomImageReadParamimg src=http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/3894/exception.jpg alt=Exception Image
Java InputStream != Readable : I am using java.util.Scanner for things such as nextInt(), and all was working fine as long as I was using a java.lang.Readable (one and only constructor argument). However, when I changed to using an InputStream instead, Scanner.nextInt() never returns. Do you know why?My implementation of the InputStream looks like this:private static class ConsoleInputStream extends InputStream {    ...    private byte[] buffer;    private int bufferIndex;    public int read() throws IOException {        ...        while (...) {            if (buffer != null amp;amp; bufferIndex  buffer.length) {                return buffer[bufferIndex++];    // THE COMMENT!            }            ...        }        ...    }}When I print the data by THE COMMENT I (correctly) get stuff like '1','2','\n' for 12\n, etc. Is there some Scanner hookup, unbeknown to me, that cause this behavior?
How to Call Java Code from MySQL? : I found an article from 2008 discussing how to a href=http://planet.mysql.com/entry/?id=13420 rel=nofollow noreferrercall Java code from MySQL. There were a lot of caveats and disclaimers because the process involved working with an experimental branch of MySQL.For a project I have in mind, it would be very useful to be be able to access Java libraries within MySQL, analogous to Oracle's a href=http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/java/jsp/index.html rel=nofollow noreferrerJava Stored Procedures.

Storing short strings and numeric values in resources in Android : I want to have some static numeric and text values as an application resource. For example my data is like this:Levels 5 First_Level 500 60 1 Second_Level 500 80 1 Third_Level 200 60 1 Fourth_Level 130 30 2 Final_Level 100 30 3... and another 300 lines...The format and order of the data is predefined and guaranteed to be valid.I could read it with java.util.Scanner, but it's extremely slow in Android, reading a 10 KB file takes minutes. It's slow because of the regular-expression-based pattern matching inside (when I traceview'ed it). What way would you suggest to store them?
Magic behind R.java file : Recently I have been having quite some problems with R.java file. Now I have decided to do a backup and delete the file to see what happens.Nothing happened, so I created an empty R.java file and hoped for the best. Now Eclipse seems to figure out that the file was tampered with and even issues a warning:R.java was modified manually! Reverting to generated version!And that's all there is. I tried building it manually but got no results. So, I have two questions:what should I do to force Eclipse to regenerate the filewhat is happening here? How is the file created, where is the code that is generating the file?I would appreciate any help. As usual the problem occurred just a few days before the deadline :)

Metro UsernameToken Policy : I created a web services client prototype using api's available in weblogic 10.3. I've been told I need to use Metro 2.0 instead (it's already being used for other projects). The problem I have encounter is that the WSDL does not include any Security Policy information but a UsernameToken is required for each method call. In weblogic I was able to write my own policy xml file and instantiate my service with it (see below), however I can not seem to figure out how to do the same using Metro.Policy.xml ?xml version=1.0?       wsp:Policy         xmlns:wsp=http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/09/policy         xmlns:sp=http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-securitypolicy/200512         sp:SupportingTokens           wsp:Policy             sp:UsernameToken               sp:IncludeToken=http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-securitypolicy/200512/IncludeToken/AlwaysToRecipient               wsp:Policy                 sp:WssUsernameToken10/               sp:HashPassword/             /wsp:Policy             /sp:UsernameToken           /wsp:Policy         /sp:SupportingTokens       /wsp:PolicyClient.java (Weblogic)      ClientPolicyFeature cpf = new ClientPolicyFeature();      InputStream asStream =  WebServiceSoapClient.class.getResourceAsStream(Policy.xml);        cpf.setEffectivePolicy(new InputStreamPolicySource(asStream));       try      {         webService = new WebService(new URL(http://192.168.1.10/WebService/WebService.asmx?wsdl), new QName(http://testme.com, WebService));      }      catch ( MalformedURLException e )      {         e.printStackTrace();      }      WebServiceSoap client = webService.getWebServiceSoap(new WebServiceFeature[] {cpf});          ListCredentialProvider credProviders = new ArrayListCredentialProvider();          String username = user;      String password = pass;      CredentialProvider cp = new ClientUNTCredentialProvider(username.getBytes(), password.getBytes());           credProviders.add(cp);      MapString, Object rc = ((BindingProvider) client).getRequestContext();        rc.put(WSSecurityContext.CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER_LIST, credProviders);...

How to pick CXF over Metro on Glassfish : I'm having a href=https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CXF-2237 rel=nofollow noreferrerthe following problem (reported there by someone else) when running my enterprise application under Glassfish. Under Jetty it works fine.a href=http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/xml/ws/spi/Provider.html rel=nofollow noreferrerjavax/xml/ws/spi/Provider mentions creating a META-INF/services/javax.xml.ws.spi.Provider resource, but this is already supplied with CXF and creating an additional resource file does not solve this problem under Glassfish.Does anyone know how to ensure that CXF is picked up under GlassFish?(I'm using a Maven Multi-modules project with CXF dependency 2.2.5)Thanks!TimEDIT #1Skipping the problem for now and just working with Metro, but I'd really like to know how to use CXF instead if anyone has any pointers.. If nothing works I might have to switch web application container (or look into Metro to fill my requirements)EDIT #2Some of the solutions detail the fix for war's by adding class-loader delegate=false/ to the sun-web.xml file. However, this does not work for non-war ee apps.
Is it possible to create an advanced login dialog for a Java Webstart application? : I implemented an advanced login dialog for a webstart application. I call it advanced because it consists of three screens: one for the actual login (user, password), one for password retrieval, and one for new user registration. The problem I am having is that the webstart support for login dialogs is somewhat poor. The server simply sends a callback object to the client asking for a username and password. The client can then show a dialog or not (depending on use case). Unfortunately the dialog does not seem have any other hooks or connections to the server (in my case Glassfish 2.1). Does anyone know how I can still implement the advanced features?Dirk

Java ImageIO: Can I convert a PNG-24 file to PNG-8? : The scenario is this:Users of the webapp can customize the website by choosing their own logo image, background colors and background images.Problem is that IE6 does not support transparent PNG. I've tried several client-side solutions, but all fall short on one aspect or the other (most don't support the css property background-repeat).I'm looking for the alternate solution of creating two separate images on the server, one for modern, transparent-png-compliant browsers and one for IE6.Question is, can I accomplish this with ImageIO? Basically, I would detect whether the image is in PNG-24 format and convert it to PNG-8 (which is supported on IE6).

Java Shell wildcard tokenizer : My Java is extremely rusty and I'm stuck trying to make a user interface that simplifies the execution of shell scripts or batch files depending on whether it's Linus or Win32  respectively. The files have the following naming convention.  module-verb-object-etc [args-list]  mysql-connect-grid  mysql-connect-rds  mysql-dump-grid  mysql-dump-grid-se314ultimately I would like it to parse unambiguous terms so I can:tokenize the commands (e.g delimited by -) amp; shorten them into simplified terms soemthing like foxpro's command window or cisco's IOS  (eg my co gr executes mysql-connect-grid in unix and *.cmd in win32)and also in the style of IOS allow the user to enter abbreviated commands so that they can type in  a question mark (?) and it will give them a hint as to the unique remaining (or next) command options (e.g. my? returns mysql  amp; my ? returns connect, or dump). Othr return values would be ambiguous or unknown for commands that are not unique or could not be matched. It may seem trivial but there are many hundreds of commands in each folder and my users don't want to think...

If it was SQL it would be something like: SELECT DISTINCT col2 FROM cmd_Grid   WHERE col1 LIKE 'cmdToken1%'  or even better: recursively setting a int depthmark for each consecutive column`SELECT DISTINCT col+str(depthmark+1) FROM cmd_Grid     WHERE col+str(depthmark) LIKE 'cmdMatchedTokens%'  until you have an exact match. I found a package called joSQL that I tried out of desperation but I cant seem to get it to work in Java6. Anyway: I was also hoping for a pure java solution so that everything could be contained in a single class... Maybe using scanner or something to parse my multidimentional array for unique values... I know I'm probably making it way more complex than it needs to be. a gentle nudge in the right direction would be appreciated.TIA
Shared jars in apache-tomcat 6.0.20 : I'm pretty new to JWS.I have a web application ( several web services ) that I want to deploy using tomcat 6.0.20 on a linux system.Everything's ok if I generate a .war file with all used libraries inside and put it in the webapps directory, but I want to have these jars shared, and the .war file itself is way too big.First I tried the intuitive way - I created a link ( WEB-INF/lib ) to the directory containing the jars, but strangely it fails to deploy ( it starts if the directory is not a link ):SEVERE: Error configuring application listener of class com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.servlet.WSServletContextListenerjava.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.servlet.WSServletContextListener        at org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader.loadClass(WebappClassLoader.java:1387)        at org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader.loadClass(WebappClassLoader.java:1233)        at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext.listenerStart(StandardContext.java:3877)        at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext.start(StandardContext.java:4429)        at org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.addChildInternal(ContainerBase.java:791)        at org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.addChild(ContainerBase.java:771)        at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardHost.addChild(StandardHost.java:526)        at org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig.deployDescriptor(HostConfig.java:630)        at org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig.deployDescriptors(HostConfig.java:556)        at org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig.deployApps(HostConfig.java:491)        at org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig.start(HostConfig.java:1206)        at org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig.lifecycleEvent(HostConfig.java:314)        at org.apache.catalina.util.LifecycleSupport.fireLifecycleEvent(LifecycleSupport.java:119)        at org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.start(ContainerBase.java:1053)        at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardHost.start(StandardHost.java:722)        at org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.start(ContainerBase.java:1045)        at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardEngine.start(StandardEngine.java:443)        at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardService.start(StandardService.java:516)        at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardServer.start(StandardServer.java:710)        at org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start(Catalina.java:583)        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39)        at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25)        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:597)        at org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap.start(Bootstrap.java:288)        at org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap.main(Bootstrap.java:413)After that I created the $CATALINA_HOME/shared/lib directory, and moved the jars there ( I've deleted the WEB-INF/lib ) and it still displays the same error - it seems tomcat isn't looking for the jars anywhere else than the WEB-INF/lib directory. But on the other hand - why would creating a symbolic link make any difference?My CATALINA_HOME and JRE_HOME vars seems to be right.
Eclipse RCP classloading problem with Metro : I am attempting to invoke a web service using the a href=http://metro.java.net/ rel=nofollow noreferrerMetro library from within an Eclipse RCP application. I bundled the relevant Metro jars (webservices-tools.jar, webservices-rt.jar, and webservices-api.jar) into a plugin and made my main application plugin depend on this new Metro plugin.I also added the webservices-api.jar to my $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/endorsed directory. According to the Metro website, this is required when using Metro with Java 1.6.Now when I invoke any web service, I get the following error:javax.xml.ws.WebServiceException: Provider com.sun.xml.ws.spi.ProviderImpl not foundat javax.xml.ws.spi.FactoryFinder.newInstance(FactoryFinder.jav a:38)at javax.xml.ws.spi.FactoryFinder.find(FactoryFinder.java:133)at javax.xml.ws.spi.Provider.provider(Provider.java:83)at javax.xml.ws.Service.init(Service.java:56)  ...

Furthermore, I have verified that my application plugin code can successfully load this class, so I'm not sure why javax.xml.ws.spi.FactoryFinder can't.Since javax.xml.ws.spi.FactoryFinder resides in webservices-api.jar (the jar I had to put in the jre's endorsed directory), I suspect that this has something to do with endorsed code not being able to load classes from an Eclipse plugin.Is it the case that code loaded by the JVM from the endorsed directory cannot load classes from plugins? Is there any way to enable this?Java version: 1.6.0_16Eclipse version: Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers Build id: 20090920-1017 (it doesn't display a version beyond that)Metro version: Bundled with Glassfish 2.1Any help is greatly appreciated.

Fastest way of processing Java IO using ASCII lines : I'm working with an ASCII input/output stream over a Socket and speed is critical. I've heard using the right Java technique really makes a difference. I have a textbook that says using Buffers is the best way, but also suggests chaining with DataInputStreamReader.For output I'm using a BufferedOutputStream with OutputStreamWriter which seems to be fine. But I am unsure on what to use for the input stream. I'm working on new lines, so would Scanner be of any use? Speed is critical, I need to get the data off the network as fast as possible.Thanks.PH
Javax.swing timer repeats fine, but ActionListener doesn't do anything : I am trying to flash the background colour in a textfield.  My timer setup is as follows: Flash flash = new Flash();                      //set up timer tmr = new javax.swing.Timer(1000, new Flash()); tmr.addActionListener(flash); tmr.setInitialDelay(0); tmr.setRepeats(true); tmr.start();                 My actionListener is as follows: static class Flash implements ActionListener {    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt)    {        if (flasher)        {            SpreademPanel.historyPnl.NameTxt.setBackground(Color.white);        }        else        {            SpreademPanel.historyPnl.NameTxt.setBackground(Color.pink);        }        flasher = !flasher;    } //actionPerformed} //FlashNow, when I put this in debug and follow the action, the program does repeatedly step through flash and toggle between the two alternatives.  But onscreen, only the first toggle occurs.  After that, no action, although flash is still functioning.What is wrong here?Thanks in advance for any help.
Java: Subclassing a genericised class : I have a genericised class that I wish to subclass as follows:public class SomeTableT extends BaseTableEntry    extends BaseTableT{    public SomeTable(int rows, int cols)    {        super(rows, cols, SomeTableEntry.class);        //Does not compile:        //Cannot find symbol: constructor BaseTable(int, int, java.lang.Classblah.blah.SomeTableEntry.class)    }}... where the genericised superclass is:public class BaseTableT extends BaseTableEntry{    public BaseTable(int rows, int cols, ClassT clasz)    {        ...    }...}I understand the compiler error, but cannot seem to find a workaround, other than to include an extra parameter in the SomeTable constructor.Any suggestions?Thanks!
Is it possible to have a 'background' Facebook App? : I need a Facebook application that kind of sit in the 'background' of user operations. Once the app is installed by the user, it will keep on sending the user's status updates, new friend connections etc to another web app of mine. It will keep on getting info no matter whether the app page is open or not.My question is -- is this possible? So far, I've played around a simple iFrame app written with the Java API. It seems that it can only perform data collections whenever the page is hit. EDIT: Privacy is definitely a valid concern here. But the application will definitely prompt for permission even if FB API is not built in to do so. 
Using -javaagent with Linux 64 bit tomcat : I m using -javagent agent.jar to instrument java classes in tomcat. While using -javaagent:location of the jar, in manifest file of the jar we will mention the premain class which gets called first and from there we can start instrumenting Byte code .                     From my Premain class(which get first called )  I add shutdownhook class to JVM.Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(ws).wsis object of  my Webserver class that extends Thread.In start() method of ws class i create a server socket new ServerSocket(port). While the JVM shutdown run() method  of Ws (Shutdownhook) is called and i close the serversocket ss.close(). In 64 bit Linux machines the port remains unclosed. In 32 bit machines with tomcat 5 the method is properly called and closed. But in 64 bit linux OS machine shutdownHook never gets called and port which i opened for serversocket remains occupied when the Tomcat shutdown 
Java Webstart intermittant JAR not updating : We use java Webstart to deploy a java application on our intranet. The application receives frequent updates. Once in awhile a user will launch the application from their desktop icon after we have updated the JARs / WAR on the webserver (timestamp changed) and Java Webstart will launch the old version instead of downloading a new one.Here is a paste of our JNLP, as you can see offline-allowed is on, but update check always and policy always. Also, download flag is eager. From my understanding these options should always result in a check of cache against timestamp on server and a download of the JAR file. I'm starting to get frustrated with Webstart! Has anyone seen similiar problems? Any solutions? I'm getting sick of walking people through clearing their webstart cache manually every third or fifth update.?xml version=1.0 encoding=utf-8?!DOCTYPE jnlp PUBLIC -//Sun Microsystems, Inc//DTD JNLP Descriptor 6.0//EN http://java.sun.com/dtd/JNLP-6.0.dtdjnlp spec=1.0+ codebase=$$codebase href=$$name  information    titleTITLE/title    vendorVENDOR/vendor    descriptionOur Utility Application/description    description kind=shortOur Utility Application PRD/description    icon href=images/util_icon.png height=64 width=64/    offline-allowed/    shortcut online=true      desktop /      menu submenu=Utility Apps/    /shortcut  /information  security     all-permissions /  /security  update check=always policy=always /  resources    !-- requires 1.6+ --    j2se version=1.6+ href=http://java.sun.com/products/autodl/j2se java-vm-args=-ea initial-heap-size=128m max-heap-size=512m /    !-- application code, download jar before we start. --    jar href=OurUpdatedJarName.jar main=true download=eager /    property name=configfile value=updatedJarName.config /  /resources  application-desc main-class=main.Client    argument-D/argument   /application-desc/jnlp
Redirecting Facebook 'offline_access' permission page : I am trying to get users' permission for 'offline_access' in an iFrame Facebook application coded with the Facebook Java API. I understand that I need to obtain an 'indefinite session key' after the users approves my application. Currently, I can accomplish what I want, but in a very awkward way that is probably not correct. There must be a better way to do this. Any thoughts/ideas would be appreciated!!What I've doneIn a servlet of my app, I check to see if the user currently has 'offline_access' permission. If they do, I get the url by Permission.authorizeUrl(Permission.OFFLINE_ACCESS). I then call response.redirect to get to the permissions page. Two problems I'm having are:The redirected permissions page is displayed within the iFrame. Hence, the Facebook book home menu bar etc. are displayed twice. i.e. looking like an app is embedded in another app. The user will be 'stuck' on the permission page once redirected there. I won't be able to obtain the 'indefinite session key' (by calling client.getCacheSessionKey) unless the user goes back to a page in my app manually. Possible Work-arounds??Is there a way to open/redirect to the permissions page in a new window? That way maybe I can have a thread in my servlet to keep checking whether the permission is set after the redirection. And then I can get the 'indefinite session key' once I have it and store it somewhere?Is there a way to set an URL for Facebook to go to after permission is set? (much like the pre-auth and post-auth URL settings?) Or somehow take control after the permission page is hit?Any other ways to setup my app maybe?? Being a newbie, I might've totally gotten the idea wrong...
how to run code compiled by JavaCompiler? : Is there any way to run program compiled by JavaCompiler? [javax.tools.JavaCompiler] My code: JavaCompiler compiler = ToolProvider.getSystemJavaCompiler();    DiagnosticCollectorJavaFileObject diagnostics = new DiagnosticCollectorJavaFileObject();    CompilationTask task = compiler.getTask(null, null, diagnostics, null, null, prepareFile(nazwa, content));    task.call();    ListString returnErrors = new ArrayListString();    String tmp = new String();    for (Diagnostic diagnostic : diagnostics.getDiagnostics()) {        tmp = String.valueOf(diagnostic.getLineNumber());        tmp +=  msg: + diagnostic.getMessage(null);        returnErrors.add(tmp.replaceAll(\n,  ));    }Now i want to run that program with lifetime 1 sec and get output to string variable.

At the command line, I can change to the folder containing the root package and type:javac rootpackage/subpackage/*.javaorjavac rootpackage/*/*.javato compile all the java classes in all the primary subpackages of my rootpackage.  However I would like to be able to do this within a Java application.  (The idea is that we provide an application to students which contains unit tests.  The unit tests need to be run against their code, the application then creates a JAR file containing their source files which have been 'watermarked' with the test results.  All this works ok, but we would like to make sure that the class files tested are created from the source files submitted, hence the idea to compile programmatically the java sources).The problem comes in that each student stores their root package in an arbitrary position, and I cannot seem to pass the location of the file to JavaCompiler (javax.tools).Is it possible, and if so, can someone give some hints on how to have an arbitrary placed root package compiled properly.CheersRichardMore Info:a student has a folder structure:/home/student/work/java/myproject/which contains the root package.  They launch the application (possibly stored in this folder - and thus no problems- however more than likely stored elsewhere) which asks them for the folder that contains the root package.  After entering, the students click a create JAR button, that compiles the files in their packages, runs the tests on the newly compiled files and then creates the JAR.  Whilst thinking through this problem, it is possible that the solution is to tell the students to install our 'create JAR' application in the folder containing their root package.
Portable Java Web Start Cache Location : I'm trying to make a java web start application portable. It stores some stuff in the user's home directory, and also a bunch of stuff in the cache. I'm using portableapps.com's portable java, and I've got it to store the home folder stuf using -J-Duser.home=Data, but how do I change the web cache, preferrably to a folder called cache in the same directory.
Can a web service call another web service in the same application server : I'm using Netbeans 6.5 to generate the JAX-WS Metro service and Glassfish 2.1 as the application server.Assume I have two web services e.g....@WebMethod(operationName = doXXX)public String doXXX(@WebParam(name = id) String id...    ...@WebMethod(operationName = doYYY)public String doYYY(@WebParam(name = result) String result... and I have a Web Service client (a Java application) that happily calls both.I now want method XXX to call method YYY i.e. I need to place the client proxy for YYY inside of web service XXX.How do I do this?
Java parsing many instances of substring from String : I am trying to write a small java program that will accept a file (using Scanner class), return the file as a String, and then search that string for any instance of a substring starting with Email: and ending with .edu. There will be many instances of this substring, each of which I want to parse out into an array or a new file.I know how to find a substring, but I do not know how to A) search for all instances of the substring and B) specify the start AND finish of the substring.Can someone help me with this logic?Thanks!
How can I make a WebMethod parameter required : We use the start from Java approach to creating JAX-WS 2.0 web services using the Metro 1.5 stack.  When we point a standard tool like SoapUI at one of our web services it indicates that parameters to WebMethods are optional.  The generated xsd shows minOccurs=0.I need a way to make WebMethod parameters required (maybe minOccurs=1 in the xsd) in the start from Java approach.  I would think there is a Java annotation for this, but I haven't been able to find one.  The XmlElement annotation has required attribute, but XmlElement cannot be applied to WebMethod parameters.Is there a way to make my WebMethod parameters required, short of manually editing the xsd and setting minOccurs to 1?
Specify own Formatter in configuration file of java logger : I wrote a Formatter (test.MyFormatter) by extending the class java.util.logging.Formatter;Now I want to use test.MyFormatter instead of java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter:in the configuration file i replaced the entry:java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter = java.util.logging.SimpleFormatterwith  java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter = test.MyFormatterunfortunately this is not working.can somebody explain me, if what I am doing is:correctif yes, why it not working?
jpegs are corrupted when resampled with java imageIO : The JPEG Images that ImageIO generated view correctly on windows file explorer, as well as safari webbrowser, but in FireFox, the resampled images are clipped.How do I use ImageIO without corrupting the resamples?The code should resize image keeping aspect ratio, as well as do jpeg compression, the convert it to a byte [] array, which could be written to a socket.some of my code. in this snippet, I tried adding Jui library, but still the same issue.public static BufferedImage imageistream;public void Resample(String child,double width,double height) throws Exception, InvalidFileStructureException, InvalidImageIndexException, UnsupportedTypeException, MissingParameterException, WrongParameterException{    String imagePath = ;    if(this.is_mac_unix == true)    {        imagePath = this.path+/+child;    }    else    {        imagePath = this.path+\\+child;    }               PixelImage bmp = null;        try {            bmp = ToolkitLoader.loadViaToolkitOrCodecs(imagePath, true, null);                      } catch (Exception e) {            // TODO Auto-generated catch block            e.printStackTrace();        }        Resample resample = new Resample();        resample.setInputImage(bmp);        double fixedRatio = width/height;        if(((double)bmp.getWidth()/bmp.getHeight()) = fixedRatio)        {        resample.setSize((int)width,(int)(bmp.getHeight()/(bmp.getWidth()/width)));        }        else        {            resample.setSize((int)width,(int)(bmp.getWidth()/(bmp.getHeight()/height)));            }        resample.setFilter(Resample.FILTER_TYPE_LANCZOS3);        resample.process();        PixelImage scaledImage = resample.getOutputImage();                 Processor.imageistream = ImageCreator.convertToAwtBufferedImage(scaledImage);        bmp = null;                      Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();        rt.gc();                        }         ...

How to detect if file exists in jnlp without opening a file dialog box? : In my jnlp app I need to know if a user property file exists, if it does, load it, my code looks like this :File_Contents=File_Open_Service.openFileDialog(.,new String[]{.txt});String Text=readFromFile(File_Contents);InputStreamReader in=new InputStreamReader(File_Contents.getInputStream());Application_Props.load(in);Users don't know the name of the property file, so even if I open a dialog box, they won't know which file to choose, so my question is : in jnlp can I do something like : if (new File(abc.txt).exists) Load_Property() ? If it doesn't exist, go on without popping up a dialog box, if it exists, don't need to open a dialog box either, just read it in, if necessary, ask the user if it's ok to read in a file named abc.txt as a property file. How to achieve this in jnlp ? Any sample code ?PS : I'm not running it in all-permissions mode, because that requires a 3rd party cert. which cost a bit.
JNLP java.security.AccessControlException with TargetDataLine.open()? : I have the following line which caused this error message run under JNLP :java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (javax.sound.sampled.AudioPermission record)    at java.security.AccessControlContext.checkPermission(Unknown Source)TargetDataLine targetDataLine.open(audioFormat);How to fix it ? Or does that mean in JNLP, we can't record sound ?PS : I'm not running it in all-permissions mode, because it requires a 3rd party paid cert. to sign the jar before I can submit my app to Sun's Java Store. I wonder if there's any other way, like using JNLP's FileSaveService / FileOpenService ?Frank

Scanner vs. BufferedReader : As far I know, the two most common methods of reading character-based data from a file in Java is using Scanner or BufferedReader. I also know that the BufferedReader read files efficiently  by using a buffer to avoid physical disk operations. My questions are:Does Scanner performs as well as BufferedReader?Why would you choose Scanner over BufferedReader or vice versa?
Convert Scala Set into Java (java.util.Set)? : I have a Set in Scala (I can choose any implementation as I am creating the Set.

ASM (from ObjectWeb) not calculating MaxStack correctly even though ClassWriter( COMPUTE_MAX + COMPUTE_STACK ) is set : I am getting expected ClassVerifyErrors when attempting to load a class i have generated using ASM. On further inspection i can see that the jvm is correct and that the method is talking about has an invalid MAX_STACK value. THe strange thing is am using the auto calculate the stack and max local options so this should not be a problem...The method with the invalid option is very simple and yet the result is bad bytecode.I have written a class with the intended method and compared my asm generated class against what javac produces and the byte codes matchup with the only error being the max stack is 0 which is wrong while javac sets a value of 2.Id like to avoid having to calculate tha max stack/locals myself.

How to make Java read very big files using Scanner? : I'm using the following basic function which I copied from the net to read a text file    public void read (){    File file = new File(/Users/MAK/Desktop/data.txt);    System.out.println(Start);    try    {        //        // Create a new Scanner object which will read the data from the        // file passed in. To check if there are more line to read from it        // we check by calling the scanner.hasNextLine() method. We then        // read line one by one till all line is read.        //        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);        int lineCount = 0;        if (scanner == null)        {            System.out.println(Null File);        }        else        {            System.out.println(scanner.toString());        }        while (scanner.hasNextLine())        {            String line = scanner.nextLine();            System.out.println(Line  + lineCount + contain :  + line);            lineCount++;        }        System.out.println(End of Try Bluck);    }    catch (FileNotFoundException e)    {        e.printStackTrace();        System.out.println(Exception Bluck);    }    System.out.println(End);}}It's working fine with medium and small size file (which contain 10 to 20 thousand line of data)However it failed to work with a file that contain 500 thousand line. I'm not getting an error (at least not seeing anyone). so what is going on? what should i do here to be able to ready such a big files?note: I already increased the heap for 2 GB on the test machine which run Windows Server 2008 with 4 GB ram. but this didn't help much!Please anyone can tell me what I should do here?Update 01The following is the outputblockquote  Start    java.util.Scanner[delimiters=\p{javaWhitespace}+][position=0][match valid=false][need input=false][source closed=false][skipped=false][group separator=\,][decimal separator=.][positive prefix=][negative prefix=\Q-\E][positive suffix=][negative suffix=][NaN string=\Q�\E][infinity string=\Q∞\E]    End of Try Bluck    End/blockquote
is there java.concurrent.util (or equivalent) for WeakHashMap? : Can the following piece of code be rewritten w/o using Collections.synchronizedMap() yet maintaining correctness at concurrency?

java.security.AccessControlException: access denied using Java Web Start : I am having some issues with accessing files using JWS (Java Web Start).  The program adds a new label and image.  The program runs fine on my local computer but gives me pages of errors when I run the program on my remote server using JWS.  Here's a sample of the error:Exception in thread AWT-EventQueue-0 java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.io.FilePermission add2.png read) at java.security.AccessControlContext.checkPermission(Unknown Source) at java.security.AccessController.checkPermission(Unknown Source) at java.lang.SecurityManager.checkPermission(Unknown Source)This occurs even after making sure the images have read access.Ideas?
Java ImageIO: How can I read a BufferedImage from file, so that it uses DataBufferFloat? : I need to read a BufferedImage from file, which doesn't use DataBufferInt (as normally), but DataBufferFloat.Please note: I don't just need some standalone DataBufferFloat, but really a BufferedImage with underlying DataBufferFloat.The API around these things is very complex, I just can't find how to do this.Please help.EDITFound out what is not working:DataBufferDouble dbd = new DataBufferDouble(destWidth * destHeight * 4);// Exception here:// java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unsupported data type 5WritableRaster wr = WritableRaster.createPackedRaster(    dbd, destWidth, destHeight, 32, new Point(0, 0));BufferedImage bi = new BufferedImage(ColorModel.getRGBdefault(),    wr, false, (Hashtable?, ?) null);
Java Web Start Authentication Option : Ok, before you think that this is a simplistic request and that it must be out there; I've done about 2-3 hours of searching with no results.  Is there a way to pass authentication information through Java Web Start (javaws) to access a password protected website?Essentially what I'm working towards is an auto-restart of a javaws application without having to re-implement what javaws does to pull the jar's down and then having to run Java on the downloaded application.  I've really been trying to find information on this but no one wants to do the same thing I'm doing (mainly because if you have authentication then you would want someone to authenticate).The authentication method is basic and I've tried embedding the username/password into the URL to no avail.  Any ideas?
Looking for a faster alternative to ImageIO : I'm attempting to encode a large quantity of BufferedImages to JPEG using the ImageWriter class in javax.imageio. Unfortunately, the encoding operation is quite slow (about 80 to 250 ms per image, not including writing to disk.) This encoding stage ends up being the slowest part of my app, so I'm hoping to optimize it.Does anyone know of an alternative to the ImageIO package that may be faster?
What is the difference between Metro 1.5 and 2.0? : In a web service client project I am working on, I noticed that the Metro stack has been released in a 2.0 version, where we use 1.4.  The documentation is not very approachable for people not intimately familiar with the project.What is the reason for the version bump, and is it worth it upgrading to the latest version?
Performance and Functionality Difference between log4j and Logging Util class : I am newbie for the logging class in Java.util package, I have developed an Application and want to implement the logging mechanism at different levels, I am just thinking to which one to go for and identify the differences between these 2.I am looking1) logger should be easily maintainable, implementable.Can any one suggest on this.
Is there a robust java.util.logging handler implementation of syslog? : I'm looking into hooking up a 3rd party Java application to our log aggregation/analysis solution (probably Splunk, we haven't finalized our selection yet though). It seems to be easiest to hook the Splunk agent to syslog, so I'm looking for a way to redirect the application logs to a local syslog daemon on the server.The Java application uses java.util.logging, which unfortunately does not feature a syslog handler out of the box (I believe log4j does, though). Are there any proven libraries to do this? The log load isn't huge (probably 10-20 messages per minute from each process, up to 6 processes per host) but I'm concerned with reliability and durability (e.g. what happens when the daemon is down?...).Any help would be appreciated...

Multithreaded Java Program for Conway's game of life - contention at the border cells : I am learning concurrent programming in java, and writing a simulation for Game of Life.Here is what I am thinking:Use int[][] to store the states of the cellspartition the int[][] into t segments and use t worker threadsThe t threads will read from their segment, calculate new values for all the cells in their segment and update the cells.Once they finished calculation they wait at a barrier for other workers to finishwhen the barrier is crossed the main thread will update the UI.the workers proceed to calculate the next state.Now there is going to be contention at the common borders of the segments. If a thread overwrote the state of a border cell before its neighbor has read the previous value, the neighbor's calculation is going to be wrong. What are my options?Use callable instead of runnable and have the worker threads return the new value (instead of updating the segments themselves). The main thread can update the matrix after the barrier is crossed. This option involves copying the results returned by worker threads into the matrix. Use two barriers. The workers thread make a copy of the border cells from their neighbors' segments and wait at the first barrier. Once this barrier is passed, they proceed to calculate the next states and update the segments in place. Then they wait at the 2nd barrier. the main thread updates the UI.My question is, is there any other way to deal with the contention at the border cells that does not involve copying data or is more efficient that the above two options? May be using ReaderWriterLock, volatile variable or other synchronizing mechanism? UPDATE: So far the a href=http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2328985/multithreaded-java-program-for-conways-game-of-life-contention-at-the-border-c/2329383#2329383double buffering solution by Peter is the cleanest one. But I have a question. Since the two arrays are shared data and we are not using any synchronization (synchronized access or volatile variable), won't it create visibility problem? Could multiple CPUs cache the array values and update only a part of the array with each iteration? Then the threads will get stale values for the border cells. Is this possible? If not, why. If yes, how do I solve it? It seems a href=http://www.javamex.com/tutorials/volatile_arrays.shtml rel=nofollow noreferrerdeclaring two arrays volatile will not make their individual elements volatile.
Applet served by Java Web Start, resources requested to WEB Server before look in the JAR files : I am new here and I apologize for my bad English.I have a little problem with an Applet class served by Java Web Start technology. I have some platform dependent JAR files which Web Start download correctly, but when I get the content by getResourceAsStream(String fileName) method of ClassLoader object, first is made a GET request of fileName to WEB Server, after received a 404 Not Found response, the resource is loaded correctly from JAR file. The problem is that I have many files inside the JAR, so I have a lot of unnecessary load on the WEB Server and consequently I have to wait for long time before I can use the Applet.Searching on Google I have found some discussions where it was said to add the parameter codebase_lookup with value false, but this has not solved the problem. a href=http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/plugin/developer_guide/special_attributes.html rel=nofollow noreferrerThis page, in relation to the codebase_lookup parameter, says that the default behavior of an Applet is to load resources from JAR file and then from the Applet codebase, in my case the behavior is the opposite.I also added the eager=true attribute for each JAR resource in the .jnlp file, but the behavior is always the same. The Applet was developed and built with NetBeans, the html and jnlp files generated are the following.launch.htmlapplet width=300 height=300        param name=jnlp_href value=launch.jnlp/        param name=codebase_lookup value=false//appletlaunch.jnlp?xml version=1.0 encoding=UTF-8 standalone=no?jnlp codebase=http://192.168.23.4/contact href=launch.jnlp spec=1.0+information    titleContactNR/title    vendorRoberto Santini/vendor    homepage href=/    descriptionContactNR/description    description kind=shortContactNR/description/informationresourcesj2se version=1.5+/jar eager=true href=ContactNR.jar main=true/jar eager=true href=lib/VDK.jar/security    all-permissions//security/resourcesresources arch=amd64 os=Linux    jar eager=true href=lib/liblinux64.jar//resourcesresources arch=x86_64 os=Linux    jar eager=true href=lib/liblinux64.jar//resourcesresources arch=x86 os=Linux    jar eager=true href=lib/liblinux.jar//resourcesresources arch=i386 os=Linux    jar eager=true href=lib/liblinux.jar//resourcesresources os=Windows    jar eager=true href=lib/libwin.jar//resourcesresources os=MacOs    jar eager=true href=lib/libmac.jar//resourcesapplet-desc height=300 main-class=com.netresults.voip.ContactNR name=ContactNR width=300    param name=codebase_lookup value=false//applet-desc/jnlpCan someone help me?Thanks at all,Roberto.

How can i deliver jetty with many webapps via jnlp? : i have a webapp (a href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/sf-mvn-plugins/files/m2-repo/net/sf/maven/plugins/example-captaincasa-jnlp/0.1-SNAPSHOT/example-captaincasa-jnlp-0.1-SNAPSHOT.war/download rel=nofollow noreferrerhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/sf-mvn-plugins/files/m2-repo/net/sf/maven/plugins/example-captaincasa-jnlp/0.1-SNAPSHOT/example-captaincasa-jnlp-0.1-SNAPSHOT.war/download) wich use jsf in a servlet container. This works fine with jetty-maven-plugin run-war target at my local pc. In the future i would like make more of this kind of weapps.Now i am looking for a way to deliver this webapps with jetty via jnlp. The end user should be have a zero installation but the webapps needs servlet container and my hoster does not support a servlet container or application server or so on.I don't like an embedded solution because in this case each webapp must be delivered with a separate jetty und run with a separate jetty - too big size - to many download size and so on.The architecture should be similar to this:img src=http://tmichel.users.sourceforge.net/files/Architecture.png alt=architectureExample: Bundle1 could contains jetty and deployed webapp1 and Bundle2 could contains jetty and deployed webapp1 and webapp2 (related to requirements of end user i would like deliver many variant of my webapps)But what is my question?1) Wich jars of jetty are needed? I would like these upload to my homepage for hosting.2) Wich jar should i use for jetty as main jar to start him via jnlp?3) Wich main class should i use to start jetty via jnlp?4) Wich parameter i could use to configure jetty to say this is war of webapp1 and this is war of webapp2.... or this is directory of weapps for hot deployment...?The important question for me is 1) If this is answered so i could run jetty local (without maven plugin) and via manual maybe i could solve the rest 2-4.

How to debug Java Web Start applications? : I have a Java Web Start Application that I launch from live site by downloading a tailored JNLP file.The problem is that once the Java Web Start application has loaded, the application quits without any warning. I know that the certificate is OK since when I enable Show site certificate from server even if it is valid option from Java settings, it displays a message correspondigly.I have tried enabling all debugging settings from Java settings (Enable tracing, Enable logging, show applet lifecycle exceptions) and also Java console, but with no luck caching the problem.Could anyone with more experience on Java Web Start development/debugging give any tips?
Calling a .NET web service (WSE 3.0, WS-Security) from JAXWS-RI : I'm writing a JAXWS-RI client that must call a .NET Web Service that is using WS-Security.  The service's WSDL does not contain any WS-Security info, but I have an example soap message from the service's authors and know that I must include wsse:Security headers, including X:509 tokens.I've been researching, and I've seen example of folks calling this type of web service from Axis and CXF (in conjunction with Rampart and/or WSS4J), but nothing about using plain JAXWS-RI itself.  However, I'm (unfortunately) constrained to using JAXWS-RI by my gov't client.  Does anyone have any examples/documentation of doing this from JAXWS-RI?  I need to ultimately generate a SOAP header that looks something like the one below - this is a sample soap:header from a .NET client written by the service's authors.

Java: use scanner delimiter as token : I'm trying to find a good way to get a Scanner to use a given delimiter as a token. For example, I'd like to split up a piece of text into digit and non-digit chunks, so ideally I'd just set the delimiter to \D and set some flag like useDelimiterAsToken, but after briefly looking through the API I'm not coming up with anything. Right now I've had to resort to using combined lookaheads/lookbehinds for the delimiter, which is somewhat painful:scanner.useDelimiter(((?=\\d)(?=\\D)|(?=\\D)(?=\\d)));This looks for any transition from a digit to a non-digit or vice-versa. Is there a more sane way to do this?
Regular Expression to Match  |  : Hey guys, I am trying to use Java's a href=http://www.ensta.fr/~diam/java/online/jdk/150/api/java/util/Scanner.html#useDelimiter%28java.lang.String%29 rel=nofollow noreferreruseDelimiter method on it's Scanner class to do some simple parsing. Basically each line is a record delimited by  | , so for example:2 | John Doe3 | Jane Doe4 | Jackie ChanThe method takes as a parameter a regular expression for which to match for. Can someone please provide me with the regular expression that would match | (A vertical bar separated by one space on both sides).Thanks, I would really appreciate it!

java Web Start is running slower than normal application running : I'm having trouble with Web Start.There is no problem if I start the application from IntelliJ.With Web Start it's working ok most of the time but at a point I'm loading 10000 records from database and there it's getting very slow.What can I do?Thanks,
How to obtain position in file (byte-position) from java scanner? : How to obtain a position in file (byte-position) from the java scanner?Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(file));scanner.useDelimiter(abc);scanner.hasNext();String result = scanner.next();and now: how to get the position of result in file (in bytes)? Using scanner.match().start() is not the answer, because it gives the position within internal buffer.
How to learn about Threads, Especially in Java : I have always been kind of confused by threads, and my class right now makes heavy use of them. We are using java.util.concurrent but I don't even really get the basics. UpDownLatch, Futures, Executors; these words just fly over my head. Can you guys suggest any resources to help learn what I need from the ground up?Thanks a lot in advance!
Unable to read JPEG image using ImageIO.read(File file) : I'm having problems reading this one JPEG file using ImageIO.read(File file) - it throws an exception with the message Unsupported Image Type.I have tried other JPEG images, and they seem to work fine.The only differance I've been able to spot is that this file seems to include a thumbnail - is that known to cause problems with ImageIO.read()?img src=https://i.imgur.com/AD5NOgEm.jpg alt=Troublesome imageEDIT:Added the resulting image:img src=https://i.imgur.com/NCdLB7hm.jpg alt=Strange colors
Java/ImageIO Validate format before reading the entire file? : I'm developing a Web application that will let users upload images. My concern is the file´s size, specially if they are invalid formats.I'm wondering if there´s a way in java (or a third party library) to check the allowed files formats (jpg, gif and png) before reading the entire file.
Automatically clearing the Java Web Start Cache : I have a Java Web Start application. I specify the resource (jars, images, etc) version and change every time there is a new version. Unfortunately sometimes the resources are not always updated when there is a new version.Is there any automated (possibly include in the application) way of clearing the web start cache?

What web server should I use if I want to run Java code behind it? : At the moment, I have lot's of Java which does all kind of nifty stuff and I'm happy with it. The code is command line driven which have been great so far, but I recently decided I want to  make the functionality available through web-services. Since my is complex and I'm happy with the way it's written , I don't want go through the pain of porting it to other languages. So I set out on a google journey to find out what web servers exist (on a Linux machine, though it's interesting to hear the answer without that limitation).From what I could find, it seems that there are two viable options: a href=http://tomcat.apache.org/ rel=nofollow noreferrerApache Tomcat and a href=http://www.sun.com/software/products/web_srvr/index.xml rel=nofollow noreferrerSun Java Server. What are the reason to choose one on top of the other? what are the strength of each and what are the weaknesses? Or, perhaps, there is a third one which is much easier, flexible and less cumbersome. Anyone?

Volatile guarantees and out-of-order execution : IMPORTANT EDIT I know about the happens before in the thread where the two assignments are happening my question is would it be possible for another thread to be reading b non-null while a is still null. So I know that if you're calling doIt() from the same thread as the one where you previously called setBothNonNull(...) then it cannot throw a NullPointerException. But what if one is calling doIt() from another thread than the one calling setBothNonNull(...) ?Note that this question is solely about the volatile keyword and the volatile guarantees: it is not about the synchronized keyword (so please don't answer you must use synchronize for I don't have any issue to solve: I simply want to understand the volatile guarantees (or lack of guarantees) regarding out-of-order execution).Say we have an object containing two volatile String references that are initialized to null by the constructor and that we have only one way to modify the two String: by calling setBoth(...) and that we can only set their references afterwards to non-null reference (only the constructor is allowed to set them to null).For example (it's just an example, there's no question yet):public class SO {    private volatile String a;    private volatile String b;    public SO() {        a = null;        b = null;    }    public void setBothNonNull( @NotNull final String one, @NotNull final String two ) {        a = one;        b = two;    }    public String getA() {        return a;    }    public String getB() {        return b;    }}In setBothNoNull(...), the line assigning the non-null parameter a appears before the line assigning the non-null parameter b.Then if I do this (once again, there's no question, the question is coming next):doIt() {    if ( so.getB() != null ) {        System.out.println( so.getA().length );    }}Am I correct in my understanding that due to out-of-order execution I can get a NullPointerException?In other words: there's no guarantee that because I read a non-null b I'll read a non-null a?Because due to out-of-order (multi)processor and the way volatile works b could be assigned before a?  volatile guarantees that reads subsequent to a write shall always see the last written value, but here there's an out-of-order issue right?  (once again, the issue is made on purpose to try to understand the semantics of the volatile keyword and the Java Memory Model, not to solve a problem).
Problem with Java Scanner sc.nextLine(); : sry about my english :)Im new to Java programming and i have a problem with Scanner. I need to read an Int, show some stuff and then read a string so i use sc.nextInt(); show my stuff showMenu(); and then try to read a string palabra=sc.nextLine();Some one told me i need to use a sc.nextLine(); after sc.nextInt(); but i dont understand why do you have to do it :(Here is my code:public static void main(String[] args) {    // TODO code application logic here    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);    int respuesta = 1;    showMenu();    respuesta = sc.nextInt();    sc.nextLine(); //Why is this line necessary for second scan to work?    switch (respuesta){        case 1:            System.out.println(=== Palindromo ===);            String palabra = sc.nextLine();            if (esPalindromo(palabra) == true)                System.out.println(Es Palindromo);            else                System.out.println(No es Palindromo);        break;    }}Ty so much for your time and Help :D
Long primitive or AtomicLong for a counter? : I have a need for a counter of type long with the following requirements/facts:Incrementing the counter should take as little time as possible.The counter will only be written to by one thread.Reading from the counter will be done in another thread.The counter will be incremented regularly (as much as a few thousand times per second), but will only be read once every five seconds.Precise accuracy isn't essential, only a rough idea of the size of the counter is good enough.The counter is never cleared, decremented.Based upon these requirements, how would you choose to implement your counter? As a simple long, as a volatile long or using an AtomicLong? Why?At the moment I have a volatile long but was wondering whether another approach would be better. I am also incrementing my long by doing ++counter as opposed to counter++. Is this really any more efficient (as I have been led to believe elsewhere) because there is no assignment being done?Thanks in advanceRich
What are the interets of synthetic methods? : ProblemOne friend suggested an interesting problem. Given the following code:public class OuterClass {    private String message = Hello World;    private class InnerClass {        private String getMessage() {            return message;        }    }}From an external class, how may I print the message variable content? Of course, changing the accessibility of methods or fields is not allowed.(the source a href=http://thecodersbreakfast.net/index.php?post/2010/03/15/Java-Quiz-35 rel=nofollow noreferrerhere, but it is a french blog)SolutionThe code to solve this problem is the following:try {    Method m = OuterClass.class.getDeclaredMethod(access$000, OuterClass.class);    OuterClass outerClass = new OuterClass();    System.out.println(m.invoke(outerClass, outerClass));} catch (Exception e) {    e.printStackTrace();}Note that the access$000 method name is not really standard (even if this format is the one that is a href=http://www.retrologic.com/innerclasses.doc10.html#19265 rel=nofollow noreferrerstrongly recommanded), and some JVM will name this method access$0. Thus, a better solution is to check for synthetic methods:Method method = null;int i = 0;while ((method == null) amp;amp; (i  OuterClass.class.getDeclaredMethods().length)) {    if (OuterClass.class.getDeclaredMethods()[i].isSynthetic()) {        method = OuterClass.class.getDeclaredMethods()[i];    }    i++;}if (method != null) {    try {        System.out.println(method.invoke(null, new OuterClass()));    } catch (Exception e) {        e.printStackTrace();    }}So the interesting point in this problem is to highlight the use of synthetic methods. With these methods, I can access a private field as it was done in the solution. Of course, I need to use reflection, and I think that the use of this kind of thing can be quite dangerous...QuestionWhat is the interest - for me, as a developer - of a synthetic method? What can be a good situation where using the synthetic can be useful?
Scala and the Java Memory Model : The Java Memory Model (since 1.5) treats final fields differently to non-final fields. In particular, provided the this reference doesn't escape during construction, writes to final fields in the constructor are guaranteed to be visible on other threads even if the object is made available to the other thread via a data race. (Writes to non-final fields aren't guaranteed to be visible, so if you improperly publish them, another thread could see them in a partially constructed state.)Is there any documentation on how/if the Scala compiler creates final (rather than non-final) backing fields for classes?  I've looked through the language specification and searched the web but can't find any definitive answers.  (In comparison the @scala.volatile annotation is documented to mark a field as volatile)
DailyRollingFileHandler ---- Files should be rotated on a daily basis : We have a requirment which requires to have an Handler that is extended from Java logging and allows to have the files rotated on daily basis.Currently Java util logging do have the support of rotation based on file size by using File Handler. It doesnt support rotation on daily basis. a href=http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6350749 rel=nofollow noreferrerhttp://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6350749So , what we are looking is for such an appender that allows  daily rotation . We would like to write such handler and which is the appropriate handler to extend for ... StreamHandler or FileHandler ?And other questions are , is there way we can configure 2 different files for a single handler say FileHandler say for eg , we would like some kind of messages need to be captured in one file and other messages in other file.Would appreciate for any comments.
Java/Groovy File IO Replacing an Image File with it's own Contents - Why Does This Work? : I have some JPG files that need to be replaced at runtime with a JFIF standardized version of themselves (we are using a vendor that gives us JPG that do not have proper headers so they don't work in certain applications)... I am able to create a new file from the existing image, then get a buffered image from that file and write the contents right back into the file without having to delete it and it works...imageSrcFolder.eachFileMatch ( ~/.*\.jpg/, {    BufferedImage bi = ImageIO.read( it )    ImageIO.write( bi, jpg, it )});The question I have is why?  Why doesn't the file end up doubled in size?  Why don't I have to delete it first?  Why am I able to take a file object to an existing file and then treat it as if it were a brand new one?  It seems that what I consider to be a file is not what the File object in java actually is, or else this wouldn't work at all.My code does exactly what I want it to do, but I'm not convinced it always will... it just seems way too easy
Java LockSupport Memory Consistency : Java 6 API question. Does calling LockSupport.unpark(thread) have a happens-before relationship to the return from LockSupport.park in the just-unparked thread? I strongly suspect the answer is yes, but the Javadoc doesn't seem to mention it explicitly.
Load a canvas from a main class - Java : I have a MyCanvas class that extends JComponent. On this canvas I have drawn a couple of things and has its own main method.     public static void main(String args[]) {    JFrame mainFrame = new JFrame(Graphics demo);    mainFrame.getContentPane().add(new Canvas0_1());    mainFrame.pack();    mainFrame.setVisible(true);   }How do I call to load the canvas from my program's other main method.

How do I keep a Scanner from throwing exceptions when the wrong type is entered? : Here's some sample code: import java.util.Scanner;class In{    public static void main (String[]arg)     {    Scanner in = new Scanner (System.in) ;    System.out.println (how many are invading?) ;    int a = in.nextInt() ;     System.out.println (a) ;     } }If I run the program and give it an int like 4, then everything goes fine. On the other hand, if I answer too many it doesn't laugh at my funny joke. Instead I get this(as expected):Exception in thread main java.util.InputMismatchException    at java.util.Scanner.throwFor(Scanner.java:819)    at java.util.Scanner.next(Scanner.java:1431)    at java.util.Scanner.nextInt(Scanner.java:2040)    at java.util.Scanner.nextInt(Scanner.java:2000)    at In.main(In.java:9)Is there a way to make it ignore entries that aren't ints or re prompt with How many are invading? I'd like to know how to do both of these.

Is it possible to specify the Java U version when using Web Start? : I have a Java WebStart application for which I want to specify that the client use JRE 1.6.0_17 or later.To the JNLP file I've tried adding:j2se version=1.6.0_17+/ or j2se version=1.6.0_17/ But when downloading JNLP file I'm given the message:The application has requested a version of the JRE(version 1.6.0_17) that is not installeddespite the fact that:java -version reports the version number on the machine as 1.6.0_17 Changing the jnlp file to use  and calling System.getProperty(java.version) reports the version that it is actually using to be 1.6.0_17Looking through the a href=http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/javawebstart/download-spec.html rel=nofollow noreferrerspec section 4.6.1 indicates that there is some difference between platform version and product version, but it isn't clear to me how I would go about using the product version (or even if I should).

How do i change this method to get strings instead of ints : here is the original code: public static int getInt () {    Scanner in = new Scanner (System.in) ;     if (in.hasNextInt())    {        int a = in.nextInt() ;         return a ;     }    else    {    System.out.println (try again:) ;     return getInt () ;     }}This checks and sees if the input it receives is an int. If it is then it returns the int, if not it tells you to try again and re-runs. This is what i tried to do to change it: public static String getIns ()     {        Scanner in = new Scanner (System.in) ;         if (in.hasNextString())        {            String a = in.nextString() ;             return a ;         }        else        {        System.out.println (try again:) ;         return getIns () ;         }    }This doesn't work though. I looked through the documentation for the scanner class and i think the problem is that there is no such method as in.hasNextString or in.nextString What methods from the scanner class can i use to do what i intend these to do?

ConcurrentLinkedQueue$Node remains in heap after remove() : I have a multithreaded app writing and reading a ConcurrentLinkedQueue, which is conceptually used to back entries in a list/table.  I originally used a ConcurrentHashMap for this, which worked well.  A new requirement required tracking the order entries came in, so they could be removed in oldest first order, depending on some conditions.  ConcurrentLinkedQueue appeared to be a good choice, and functionally it works well.A configurable amount of entries are held in memory, and when a new entry is offered when the limit is reached, the queue is searched in oldest-first order for one that can be removed.  Certain entries are not to be removed by the system and wait for client interaction.What appears to be happening is I have an entry at the front of the queue that occurred, say 100K entries ago.  The queue appears to have the limited number of configured entries (size() == 100), but when profiling, I found that there were ~100K ConcurrentLinkedQueue$Node objects in memory.  This appears to be by design, just glancing at the source for ConcurrentLinkedQueue, a remove merely removes the reference to the object being stored but leaves the linked list in place for iteration.Finally my question:  Is there a better lazy way to handle a collection of this nature?  I love the speed of the ConcurrentLinkedQueue, I just cant afford the unbounded leak that appears to be possible in this case.  If not, it seems like I'd have to create a second structure to track order and may have the same issues, plus a synchronization concern.
How to secure Java webservices with login and session handling : I'd like to secure my (Java metro) webservice with a login.Here's how I'm planning to do that:Steps required when calling a webservice method are:call login(user,pwd), receive a session token1.1 remember the tokencall servicemethod (token, arg1, arg2...)webservice checks if the token is known, if not throw exception otherwise proceedlogout or timeout after x time periods of inactivitymy questions:1. what's your opinion on this approach? does it make sense?2. are there any libraries which take the burden of writing a session handling (maybe with database persistence to survive app restarts)(the solution should be simple and easily usable with Java and .NET clients)thanks!

How do I pull `static final` constants from a Java class into a Clojure namespace? : I am trying to wrap a Java library with a Clojure binding.  One particular class in the Java library defines a bunch of static final constants, for example:class Foo {    public static final int BAR = 0;    public static final int SOME_CONSTANT = 1;    ...}I had a thought that I might be able to inspect the class and pull these constants into my Clojure namespace without explicitly def-ing each one.  For example, instead of explicitly wiring it up like this:(def foo-bar Foo/BAR)(def foo-some-constant Foo/SOME_CONSTANT)I'd be able to inspect the Foo class and dynamically wire up foo-bar and foo-some-constant in my Clojure namespace when the module is loaded.I see two reasons for doing this:A) Automatically pull in new constants as they are added to the Foo class.  In other words, I wouldn't have to modify my Clojure wrapper in the case that the Java interface added a new constant.B) I can guarantee the constants follow a more Clojure-esque naming conventionI'm not really sold on doing this, but it seems like a good question to ask to expand my knowledge of Clojure/Java interop.  Thanks

An equivalent of -javaagent in C#?

I have the source code of this framework.I know there are several possibilities for using java libraries in C# (although I'm not familiar with any of them, so I'd appreciate suggestions). So far I've thought of using a href=http://www.ikvm.net/uses.html rel=nofollow noreferrerIKVM.NET to generate a .dll, but I'm not sure what to do next, because in java in order to run the framework with your code a href=http://sites.google.com/site/deucestm/documentation/getting-started rel=nofollow noreferreryou're supposed to use the option -javaagent by adding-javaagent:bin/deuceAgent.jar  (where deuceAgent is the framework)to your java command line. I don't know what the equivalent in C# would be once I have my .dll, or whether there's an equivalent at all.Any help? Thanks so much.

But if somebody has encountered similar issue or has some ideas to try, they are welcome =)Java version used at the client is 6u18.Br, Touko

Using Glassfish libraries in proprietary software : I would like to use some parts of Glassfish in a proprietary software that are under a CDDL + GPLv2 license. Am I allowed to do that? I haven't modified anything in the code of these libraries, so is this OK, or my software, because it uses these libraries, is still considered derivative work, and thus a big no-no?I mean, according to a href=http://jaxb.java.net/ rel=nofollow noreferrerhttp://jaxb.java.net/, JAXB is also under CDDL + GPLv2, but I know I can freely use that in proprietary software. Is this because CDDL + GPLv2 actually allows that, or is it distributed under a different license when bundled with the JRE?
How to resolve Line End Reading with Scanner Class in Java : I am not an experienced Java programmer and i'm trying to write some text to a file and then read it with Scanner. I know there are lots of ways of doing this, but i want to write records to file with delimiters, then read the pieces.The problem is so small. When I look the output some printing isn't seen(shown in below). I mean the bold line in the Output that is only written Scanner. I would be appreciated if anyone can answer why String:  isn't seen there. (Please answer just what i ask)I couldn't understand if it is a simple printing problem or a line end problem with \r\n.Here is the code:    import java.io.FileReader;    import java.io.FileWriter;    import java.io.IOException;    import java.util.Scanner;public class Tmp {    public static void main(String args[]) throws IOException {        int i;        boolean b;        String str;        FileWriter fout = new FileWriter(test.txt);        fout.write(Testing|10|true|two|false\r\n);        fout.write(Scanner|12|one|true|);        fout.close();        FileReader fin = new FileReader(Test.txt);        Scanner src = new Scanner(fin).useDelimiter([|\\*]);        while (src.hasNext()) {            if (src.hasNextInt()) {                i = src.nextInt();                System.out.println(int:  + i);            } else if (src.hasNextBoolean()) {                b = src.nextBoolean();                System.out.println(boolean:  + b);            } else {                str = src.next();                System.out.println(String:  + str);            }        }        fin.close();    }}   Here is the output:String: Testingint: 10boolean: trueString: twoString: falseScannerint: 12String: oneboolean: true

Insert one DefaultStyledDocument into another DefaultStyledDocument : I want to insert one DefaultStyledDocument into another DefaultStyledDocument.  How do I do this?

Java - How do I get last line using Scanner? :         while( inStream.hasNextLine() )        {                ...                lineList.add( inStream.nextLine() );        }        ...lineList is an ArrayList. The code is reading everything nicely except it won't grab the last line. The last two lines in the text file end like this:a sentence here...a blank line here. the blank line is the last lineI'm assuming it won't grab it since hasNextLine() is not detecting another line after this one?What's a way to grab the last line? I thought reading until it was EOF and then catching the exception might work but there doesn't seem to be a way to do that.EDIT: MORE INFOpublic void readLines(){    lineList = new ArrayList();    try    {        inStream = new Scanner( new File( fileName ) );    }    catch( FileNotFoundException e )    {        System.out.println( Error opening the file. Try again. );    }    if ( inStream != null )    {        while( inStream.hasNextLine() )        {            ++originalLines;            lineList.add( inStream.nextLine() );        }        inStream.close();    }}There's the whole method. Anything wrong?EDIT: EVEN MORE INFO public static void main(String[] args){    Scanner inStream = null;    String test = ;    inStream = new Scanner( test );    while( inStream.hasNextLine() )    {        System.out.println( inStream.nextLine() );    }}It will not pick up an empty string but it will pick up a whitespace

How to build your non-gui Java program into a console program : I dont know how to describe it well, but i will try. Ok, i want to be able to build my java program so that when it opens, it will look and work exactly as it does in the console.  So it reads the Scanner class and prints normally, and does everything it would do if it was in the console.  Ive looked around for this and havent found anything.  I can make a gui java program fairly easily, but i would rather have a terminal, console like program, that works exactly as the java console, thanks.
How could I embed a html/css/js view in a webstart application : I would like to use a html/css/js view in my webstart project without requesting all permissions.I figured out that I could use the java HTTPServer to process the requests but I need a way to avoid using real sockets, so that the HTTPServer instantiation doesn't ask for some permission.Do you know any projects that achieve that ? and if not, what should I do to get an HTTPServer completely working locally (without hitting boundaries...) ?edit: maybe an HTTPServer is too much, I maybe only need a HttpHandler..
Java.util.scanner error handling : I'm helping a friend with a java problem. However, we've hit a snag. We're using Java.Util.Scanner.nextInt() to get a number from the user, asking continiously if the user gives anything else. Only problem is, we can't figure out how to do the error handeling.  What we've tried:do {  int reloop = 0;  try {    number = nextInt();   } catch (Exception e) {    System.out.println (Please enter a number!);    reloop ++;   }} while(reloop != 0);Only problem is, this loops indefinatly if you enter in something not a number.Any help?
JFrame that has multiple layers : I have a window that has two layers: a static background and a foreground that contains moving objects. My idea is to draw the background just once (because it's not going to change), so I make the changing panel transparent and add it on top of the static background. Here is the code for this:public static void main(String[] args) {    JPanel changingPanel = new JPanel() {        @Override        public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {            super.paintComponent(g);            g.setColor(Color.RED);            g.fillRect(100, 100, 100, 100);        }    };    changingPanel.setOpaque(false);    JPanel staticPanel = new JPanel();    staticPanel.setBackground(Color.BLUE);    staticPanel.setLayout(new BorderLayout());    staticPanel.add(changingPanel);    JFrame frame = new JFrame();    frame.add(staticPanel);    frame.setSize(800, 600);    frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);    frame.setVisible(true);}This piece of code gives me the correct image I want, but every time I repaint changingPanel, staticPanel gets repainted as well (which is obviously against the whole idea of painting the static panel just once). Can somebody show me what's wrong?FYI I am using the javax.swing.Timer to recalculate and repaint the changing panel 24 times every second.
get entire line with java.util.scanner.hasNext(regex) : I'm doing something in Java that requires input to be matched against the pattern ^[1-5]$. I should have a while loop looping through each line of input, checking it against the pattern, and outputting an error message if it does not.  Sudo code:  while (regex_match(/^[^1-5]$/,inputLine)) {      print (Please enter a number between 1 and 5! );      getNextInputLine();}  I can use java.util.Scanner.hasMatch(^[^1-5]$), but that will only match a single token, not the entire line. Any idea on how to make hasMatch match against the entire line? (Setting the delimiter to \n or \0 doesn't work.)Edit: If this isn't possible, is there some other way to do it?
Imageiio can't create imageinput stream : When using imageio.imageio.read iget a can't create ImageInputStream.

How to restart the Java Process with -Djava.library.path? : I have an application that is started with JWS. The first time user launches this application he has to choose a path where Berkeley DB XML is installed. I do need this to set the native library path and restart the application with -Djava.library.path parameter. Berkeley DB XML java bindings uses JNI to make calls to the database. Since our users may have different OS I cannot rely on a default location. So, I have a problem with getting current classpath. When I print out java.class.path it only gives me /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Resources/Deploy.bundle/Contents/Home/lib/deploy.jar. I have three jars that I cannot find in my sys props.on my Mac.I hope this was understandable and thanks for any tips beforehand.
Change root package of Java JAR : I am writing a Java Agent which makes use of the Java ASM library for handling byte code. This is a common library and I want to be sure about the version of ASM which my code is using at runtime.What is the easiest and most automated way to take the ASM classes and process them into a private copy where all the classes have been relocated into a new root package. To be specific, I want to take the ASM jars and turn org.objectweb.asm.* into org.myproject.internal.org.objectweb.asm.*Please remember that I am mostly interested in an automated solution. I know that I could get the sources for ASM and do this manually or with a script and then recompile the jars but this feels like a lot of overhead.
is appassembler plugin broken for java service wrapper on windows 64bit? : I'm developing on 32bit windows and am using appassembler to create a java service wrapper assembly, and it works ok. But I need to also create a 64bit assembly for deployment to a dev server. In the following config I have substituted the 32bit platform with the 64bit, see the includes section. But it no longer places the wrapper jar and dll in the lib folder. If I omit the includes completely, I get linux, solaris, Mac OSX and Win32 libraries, but no win64.Anyone got this working?        plugin            groupIdorg.codehaus.mojo/groupId            artifactIdappassembler-maven-plugin/artifactId            version1.1-SNAPSHOT/version            configuration                target${project.build.directory}/appassembler/target                repositoryLayoutflat/repositoryLayout                defaultJvmSettings                    initialMemorySize256M/initialMemorySize                    maxMemorySize1024M/maxMemorySize                /defaultJvmSettings                daemons                    daemon                        idMyApp/id                        mainClasscom.foo.AppMain/mainClass                        platforms                            platformjsw/platform                        /platforms                        generatorConfigurations                            generatorConfiguration                                generatorjsw/generator                                includes                                    includewindows-x86-64/include                                /includes                                configuration                                    property                                        nameset.default.REPO_DIR/name                                        value../../repo/value                                    /property                                /configuration                            /generatorConfiguration                        /generatorConfigurations                    /daemon                /daemons            /configuration            executions                execution                    goals                        goalgenerate-daemons/goal                        goalcreate-repository/goal                    /goals                /execution            /executions        /plugin
Slow Startup for Java Web Start Application : I'm using the Netbeans IDE to develop a Java Web Start application that will launch from the web and then use the EclipseLink JPA to access a remote MySQL database. I'm using the Swing Application Framework to manage life cycle for my app. When I launch the application from Netbeans it takes about 7 second for my application to load, but when I use the Netbeans IDE to create a Web Start distribution package (with the JAR and JNLP files) it takes about 60 seconds to launch. Also, the verifying application/downloading application progressbar window seems to run every time I launch the app even though a copy of it has already been cached. From the users point of view, one first sees my splash screen for 1 to 2 seconds, then the verifying application/downloading application progressbar window for 5 to 20 seconds and then nothing for a good 40 seconds before the application launches. The app code is written such that it should show itself BEFORE the JPA starts loading the persistence unit (so I doubt that's the problem), but I thought I'd mention it just in case.Update: Method createEntityManagerFactory Slow With Web StartHaving looked into this further, I've found that the method createEntityManagerFactory--which is necessary for EclipseLink to connect to MySQL--takes aboutn 5 seconds to execute when I run the applicaiton from Netbeans or when I remotely log in to my server to launch the JNLP there, but when I run the application via the web the same line takes 35 seconds (hugely delaying startup). Interestingly, this time gets even worse as my internet connection speed gets worse. Below is a copy of the JNLP file I'm using.Does anyone have any idea what may be causing such a delay??xml version=1.0 encoding=UTF-8 standalone=no?

Web Start Application built on NetBeans Platform doesn't create desktop shortcut  start menu item : I've created a NetBeans Platform application that is launched using Java Web Start. I built the WAR file using the 'Build JNLP Application'-command in Netbeans 6.8.I've added a desktop shortcut and menu item to the JNLP file, but for some reason, these are not created when the application is launched.However, when I go to:blockquote  Control Panel - Java - Temporary  Internet Files - View - Select my  application  Click 'Install shortcuts  to the selected application'/blockquotethe desktop and menu shortcuts are created correctly.Also, in the Java Console, the Shortcut Creation option is set to the following (the default, I presume):Prompt user if hintedBelow is a snippet of my JNLP file:jnlp spec=6.0+ codebase=$$codebase         information         title${app.title}/title         vendorSomeVendor (Pty) Ltd/vendor         descriptionSome description/description         icon href=${app.icon}/               shortcut online=true            desktop/            menu submenu=MyApp/         /shortcut         /information      ...I'm stumped.

ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor executing a wrong time because of CPU time discrepancy : I'm scheduling a task using a ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor object.  I use the following method:public ScheduledFuture? schedule(Runnable command, long delay,TimeUnit unit) and set the delay to 30 seconds (delay = 30,000 and unit=TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).  Sometimes my task occurs immediately and other times it takes 70 seconds.I believe the ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor uses CPU specific clocks.  When i run tests comparing System.currentTimeMillis(), System.nanoTime() [which is CPU specific] i see the followingschedule: 1272637682651ms, 7858346157228410nsexecute:  1272637682667ms, 7858386270968425nsdifference is 16ms but 4011374001ns (or 40,113ms)so it looks like there is discrepancy between two CPU clocks of 40 secondsHow do i resolve this issue in java code?  Unfortunately this is a clients machine and i can't modify their system.

Java 1.5.0_16 corrupted colours when saving jpg image : i have a loaded image from disk (stored as a BufferedImage), which i display correctly on a JPanel but when i try to re-save this image using the command below, the image is saved in a reddish hue.ImageIO.write(image, jpg, fileName);Note! image is a BufferedImage and fileName is a File object pointing to the filename that will be saved which end in .jpg.I have read that there were problems with ImageIO methods in earlier JDKs but i'm not on one of those versions as far as i could find.  What i am looking for is a way to fix this issue without updating the JDK, however having said that i would still like to know in what JDK this issue was fixed in (if it indeed is still a bug with the JDK i'm using).Thanks.
Developing for Android in Eclipse: R.java not regenerating : I've found out that my R.java is never updated, so it doesn't contain information about my new resources, so I decided to delete it and thought that Eclipse would generate a new one. But that didn't happen, and I don't have R.java now. How can I regenerate one?I'm using Windowsnbsp;7. From one of the comments: Doing Project - Clean is what caused the problem for me. Cleaning deletes R.java...and for whatever reason the plugin is not regenerating the file.

roll out of java web start clients : We are about to roll out a client server application build with java web start. Our main server is located in a country in Europe and we will have many users downloading our client the first day from all over the world.

Is there a way to cache or pre- distribute java web start clients to servers closer to the user (for example a local server)?Thanks.
Java Scanner won't follow file : Trying to tail / parse some log files.

Metro  StreamBuffer namespace error - am I understanding this correctly? : All,  I'm (still) working on calling a WSE 3.0 .NET web service from Java/Metro 2.0.  We've got the security requirements set so that we're encrypting the body amp; header of the messages amp; signing the headers.  I'm able to send a request to their service amp; get a response, but Metro is unable to validate the signature amp; throws an error from the WSIT code.  I got the latest WSIT code from CVS amp; here's a code snippet of the method that's blowing up:from com.sun.xml.ws.security.opt.impl.incoming.GenericSecuredHeader:private XMLStreamBuffer completeHeader;public void writeTo(XMLStreamWriter w) throws XMLStreamException {        try {            // TODO what about in-scope namespaces            completeHeader.writeToXMLStreamWriter(w);        } catch (Exception e) {            throw new XMLStreamException(e);        }    }As you can see, there's a TODO in there, that I think indicates that the method can't handle the situation I have, but I'm not sure I know what they mean by 'in-scope' namespaces.Here's the snippet of XML from the web service response that it's breaking on:wsa:Action wsu:Id=Id-46282a5d-c7fa-403c-8ac9-f7df0dfdb0cfhttp://someAction/wsa:ActionSignature xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#SignedInfods:CanonicalizationMethod Algorithm=http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n# xmlns:ds=http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig# /SignatureMethod Algorithm=http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1 /Reference URI=#Id-46282a5d-c7fa-403c-8ac9-f7df0dfdb0cfTransformsTransform Algorithm=http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n# //TransformsDigestMethod Algorithm=http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#sha1 /DigestValue/2ivNKDpYSLqPWHzrSxN/RuZ/e8=/DigestValue/ReferenceIn the stack trace (included below), it complains about not being able to validate the reference URI=#Id-46282a5d-c7fa-403c-8ac9-f7df0dfdb0cf.  What I'm unclear on is - is it failing because the Reference element doesn't have a namespace attribute or prefix?  Should they be allowed to inherit the namespace from the parent Signature element, or can the StreamBuffer classes not handle that?To contrast, here's a similar XML snippet from my request (generated by WSIT), where the ds prefix is xmlns:ds=http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#ds:Signature xmlns:ns10=http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope xmlns:ns11=http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-secureconversation/200512 xmlns:ns12=http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2006/02/addressingidentity Id=_1ds:SignedInfods:CanonicalizationMethod Algorithm=http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n#exc14n:InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList=wsse S//ds:CanonicalizationMethodds:SignatureMethod Algorithm=http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1/ds:Reference URI=#_5002ds:Transformsds:Transform Algorithm=http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n#exc14n:InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList=S//ds:Transform/ds:Transformsds:DigestMethod Algorithm=http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#sha1/ds:DigestValuevtf9n+OcI1nT0exavD4/ZQy6jm8=/ds:DigestValue/ds:ReferenceWhen Metro generates these blocks, everything has a namespace prefix.

Make WebStart Java desktop application to start on system startup on Windows and Mac : I developed small cross-platform (Windows and Mac) SWT desktop application. It is distributed with WebStart. So far so good, everything works.I've got a new requirement to make my app start on system startup (with no user interaction). What is the best way to accomplish that?In JNLP file I've got this:shortcut online=false    desktop/    menu submenu=CompanyName//shortcutOn Windows WebStart creates a desktop link [app_name].lnk and it points tojavaws.exe and then some Java cache file as a parameter with funny name like ..\Sun\Java\Deployment\cache\6.0\4\2c0a6a781-213476. I can possibly programmatically find that link on user's machine by name... erm... and then copy it into user's Startup folder. I can see a problem here though as user can disable WebStart desktop shortcut creation option all together.On Mac WebStart pops up a dialog to prompt user for the location where to create an [app_name].app (user is allowed to change link name there!) file that launches an application. On Mac I don't event know where the Startup folder is located (a href=http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Articles/CustomLogin.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20002134-SW2 rel=nofollow noreferrerand it seems to be much more complex there).Is there Java library out there that abstracts start app on system startup concept on different platforms as SWT does for GUI abstraction?

Loading .eml files into javax.mail.Messages : I'm trying to unit test a method which processes javax.mail.Message instances.I am writing a converter to change emails which arrive in different formats and are then converted into a consistent internal format (MyMessage).  This conversion will usually depend on the from-address or reply-address of the email, and the parts of the email, the subject, and the from- and reply-addresses will be required for creating the new MyMessage.I have a collection of raw emails which are saved locally as .eml files, and I'd like to make a unit test which loads the .eml files from the classpath and converts them to javax.mail.Message instances.  Is this possible, and if so, how would it be done?
DefaultStyledDocument.styleChanged(Style style) may not run in a timely manner? : I'm experiencing an intermittent problem with a class that extends javax.swing.text.DefaultStyledDocument.  This document is being sent to a printer.  Most of the time the formatting of the document looks correct, but once in a while it doesn't.  It looks like some of the changes in the formatting have not been applied.I took a look at the DefaultStyledDocument.styleChanged(Style style) code:/** * Called when any of this document's styles have changed. * Subclasses may wish to be intelligent about what gets damaged. * * @param style The Style that has changed. */protected void styleChanged(Style style) {    // Only propagate change updated if have content    if (getLength() != 0) {        // lazily create a ChangeUpdateRunnable        if (updateRunnable == null) {            updateRunnable = new ChangeUpdateRunnable();        }        // We may get a whole batch of these at once, so only        // queue the runnable if it is not already pending        synchronized(updateRunnable) {            if (!updateRunnable.isPending) {                SwingUtilities.invokeLater(updateRunnable);                updateRunnable.isPending = true;            }        }    }}/** * When run this creates a change event for the complete document * and fires it. */class ChangeUpdateRunnable implements Runnable {    boolean isPending = false;public void run() {        synchronized(this) {            isPending = false;        }    try {    writeLock();    DefaultDocumentEvent dde = new DefaultDocumentEvent(0,                      getLength(),                      DocumentEvent.EventType.CHANGE);    dde.end();    fireChangedUpdate(dde);    } finally {    writeUnlock();    }}}Does the fact that SwingUtilities.invokeLater(updateRunnable) is called, rather than invokeAndWait(updateRunnable), mean that I can't count on my formatting changes appearing in the document before it is rendered?If that is the case, is there a way to ensure that I don't proceed with rendering until the updates have occurred?
Clob as param for PL/SQL Java Stored Procedure : I have a java stored procedure that takes in a clob representing a chunk of javascript and mins it.  The structure of the function calling the JSP is as follows:function MIN_JS(pcl_js in clob) return clob as  language java name 'JSMin.min(oracle.sql.CLOB) return oracle.sql.CLOB';In the actual JSP, I have the following:import oracle.sql.CLOB;public class JSMin {...public static min(CLOB js) {...}The problem I'm having is that whenever I pass a clob to JS_MIN, it is always interpreted as null inside the JSP.

Java Webstart Truststore SSL : Need some guidance. I have java webstart app and I want it to connect to a server via SSL.just adding a property like:System.setProperty(javax.net.ssl.trustStore,my.keystore);But since a JAWS program is downloaded from server didn't work and don't have a my.keystore on local file system. So decided to distribute the certificate to all clients.I did the following and it worked.Read this trust store as a stream (use getResourceAsStream method).Save it in any file on the client machine (sometemp)Call System.setProperty (javax.net.ssl.trustStore, trustStorePath);But I am sure there must be better solutions than this..

Downloading Spreadsheets From Google Docs : I am working on an Android app that uses the gdata-java-client to download documents for display only. So far I have an application that authenticates with the services and displays a list of user documents. When the user selects a document another query is made for the documents itself. A request for txt, html, rtf and doc files works well, however when I request a spreadsheet in either .csv or .xsl format the result is unexpected. I'm using an HTTPResponse object to store the result of a an HTTPRequest. When I request a document in .csv or .xsl format the HTTPResponse.parseAsString() method produces an entire html page which appears to be the Google Docs home page. Sounds strange, but the result is the actual html for the login page. The HTTPResponse.getStatusMessage returns a 200. Seems like I am missing something simple here. Is there another property of the HTTPResponse that contains the .csv data? I am pretty sure that I am using the correct uri for downloading spreadsheets because it works when I download through my browser. In any case here is an example uri:https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/download/spreadsheets/Export?key=0AsE_6_YIr797dHBTUWlHMUFXeTV4ZzJlUGxWRnJXancamp;exportFormat=csvThanks in advance for any help :)

Are there any good Java API for facebook? : I've played around a bit with twitter4j and found it absolutely wonderful. Now I've been looking into the equivalent for facebook but so far haven't had much luck finding a decent project.I looked into a href=http://code.google.com/p/facebook-java-api/ rel=nofollow noreferrerfacebook-java-api but it appears that they break their API from release to release. I consider this unacceptable.I'm currently playing around a bit with a href=http://restfb.com/ rel=nofollow noreferrerRestFB and the API seems decent so far but I've been having some connection problems.I'm just looking for a simple library that lets me post status updates, send direct messages and get a list of friends through minimal coding effort.Has anyone had any success using a java API for facebook and if so, what are you using?  Thanks.
Has anyone gotten jax-ws-catalog.xml to resolve schemaLocation locally on Metro? : I have added a jax-ws-catalog.xml to my .war file in order to resolve the schemaLocation locally instead of remotely in .

(I can post the contents of my jax-ws-catalog.xml and the relevant xsd and wsdl if that will help.A Google search turns up lots of other problems with jax-ws-catalog.xml not working in the Metro stack.Has anyone gotten a jax-ws-catalog.xml to work in Metro?
Java Webstart...interaction with browsers on different platforms : This post is similar to a href=http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1119591/launching-a-browser-window-from-java-webstart-jnlp-in-java-6u13this post, but not exactly, so I'm asking this question.How does one go about, From a Java WebStart app:launch a new browser window with a target URL?bring an existing browser window intofocus with a target URL?Is the solution OS/platform independent?  Does it matter which browser you're talking to?
filling array gradually with data from user : I'm trying to fill an array with words inputted by user. Each word must be one letter longer than previous and one letter shorter than next one. Their length is equal to table row index, counting from 2. Words will finally create a one sided pyramid, like :AABABCABCDScanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);System.out.println(Give the height of array: );height = sc.nextInt();String[] words = new String[height];for(int i=2; iheight+2; i++){    System.out.println(Give word with +i+ letters.);    words[i-2] = sc.next();    while( words[i-2].length()i-2 || words[i-2].length()words[i-3].length() ){        words[i-2] = sc.next();    }}How can I limit words read from scanner to fill the requirements?Currently the while loop doesn't influence scanner at all :/This is not a homework. I'm trying to create a simple application and then gui for it.

Why would I want to use anything other than WCF? : After completing several small projects with WCF, I'm quite happy with what it can do.However, having spent a brief amount of time looking into the alternatives, I'm struggling to find exactly what benefits/drawbacks I would experience from using Java based web services such as AXIS2 or Metro?Obviously open-source is perhaps one of them and also breaking away from Windows Server/IIS, but I can't see much more?
How can I define a clojure type that implements the servlet interface? : I'm attempting to use deftype (from the bleeding-edge clojure 1.2 branch) to create a java class that implements the java Servlet interface.  I would expect the code below to compile (even though it's not very useful).(ns foo [:import [javax.servlet Servlet ServletRequest ServletResponse]])(deftype servlet []    javax.servlet.Servlet    (service [this          #^javax.servlet.ServletRequest request         #^javax.servlet.ServletResponse response]   nil))But it doesn't compile.  The compiler produces the message:Mismatched return type: service, expected: void, had: java.lang.Object  [Thrown class java.lang.IllegalArgumentException]Which doesn't make sense to me, because I'm returning nil.  So the fact that the return type of the method is void shouldn't be a problem.  For instance, for the java.util.Set interface:(deftype bar [#^Number n] java.util.Set (clear [this] nil))compiles without issue.So what am I doing wrong with the Servlet interface?To be clear: I know that the typical case is to subclass one of the servlet abstract classes rather than  implement this interface directly, but it should still be possible to do this.

How do I send an email with embedded images and regular attachments in JavaMail? : I'd like to know how to build an SMTP multipart message in the correct order so that it will render correctly on the iPhone mail client (rendering correctly in GMail).I'm using Javamail to build up an email containing the following parts:A body part with content type text/html; UTF-8An embedded image attachment.A file attachmentI am sending the mail via GMail SMTP (via SSL) and the mail is sent and rendered correctly using a GMail account, however, the mail does not render correctly on the iPhone mail client. On the iPhone mail client, the image is rendered before the Before Image text when it should be rendered afterwards. After the Before Image text there is an icon with a question mark (I assume it means it couldn't find the referenced CID). I'm not sure if this is a limitation of the iPhone mail client or a bug in my mail sending code (I strongly assume the latter).I think that perhaps the headers on my parts might by incorrect or perhaps I am providing the multiparts in the wrong order.

Can ASM method-visitors be used with interfaces? : I need to write a tool that lists the classes that call methods of specified interfaces. It will be used as part of the build process of a large java application consisting of many modules. The goal is to automatically document the dependencies between certain java modules.I found several tools for dependency analysis, but they don't work on the method level, just for packages or jars. Finally I found ASM, that seems to do what I need.The following code prints the method dependencies of all class files in a given directory:import java.io.*;import java.util.*;import org.objectweb.asm.ClassReader;public class Test {    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {        File dir = new File(args[0]);        ListFile classFiles = new LinkedListFile();        findClassFiles(classFiles, dir);        for (File classFile : classFiles) {            InputStream input = new FileInputStream(classFile);            new ClassReader(input).accept(new MyClassVisitor(), 0);            input.close();        }    }    private static void findClassFiles(ListFile list, File dir) {        for (File file : dir.listFiles()) {            if (file.isDirectory()) {                findClassFiles(list, file);            } else if (file.getName().endsWith(.class)) {                list.add(file);            }        }    }}import org.objectweb.asm.MethodVisitor;import org.objectweb.asm.commons.EmptyVisitor;public class MyClassVisitor extends EmptyVisitor {    private String className;    @Override    public void visit(int version, int access, String name, String signature,            String superName, String[] interfaces) {        this.className = name;    }    @Override    public MethodVisitor visitMethod(int access, String name, String desc,            String signature, String[] exceptions) {        System.out.println(className + . + name);        return new MyMethodVisitor();    }}import org.objectweb.asm.commons.EmptyVisitor;public class MyMethodVisitor extends EmptyVisitor {    @Override    public void visitMethodInsn(int opcode, String owner, String name,            String desc) {        String key = owner + . + name;        System.out.println(   + key);    }}The Problem:The code works for regular classes only! If the class file contains an interface, visitMethod is called, but not visitMethodInsn. I don't get any info about the callers of interface methods.Any ideas?
Java Scanner newline parsing with regex (Bug?) : I'm developing a syntax analyzer by hand in Java, and I'd like to use regex's to parse the various token types. The problem is that I'd also like to be able to accurately report the current line number, if the input doesn't conform to the syntax.Long story short, I've run into a problem when I try to actually match a newline with the Scanner class. To be specific, when I try to match a newline with a pattern using the Scanner class, it fails. Almost always. But when I perform the same matching using a Matcher and the same source string, it retrieves the newline exactly as you'd expect it too. Is there a reason for this, that I can't seem to discover, or is this a bug, as I suspect?FYI: I was unable to find a bug in the Sun database that describes this issue, so if it is a bug, it hasn't been reported.Example Code:Pattern newLinePattern = Pattern.compile((\\r\\n?|\\n), Pattern.MULTILINE);String sourceString = \r\n\n\r\r\n\n;Scanner scan = new Scanner(sourceString);scan.useDelimiter();int count = 0;while (scan.hasNext(newLinePattern)) {    scan.next(newLinePattern);    count++;}System.out.println(found +count+ newlines); // finds 7 newlinesMatcher match = newLinePattern.matcher(sourceString);count = 0;while (match.find()) {    count++;}System.out.println(found +count+ newlines); // finds 5 newlines
Java Client interoperating with WSE 3.0 Web Service : I have a Interoperable Security Token Service (STS) that authenticates the User and then issues a SAML token. I also have transaction services that expects the SAML token in the incoming SOAP request header.For a client to make a call to transaction service, it first needs to authenticate with the STS, get the SAML token and then make a call to the transaction services. The STS is an interoperable service and can be invoked from a Java client. The Transaction services are build using WSE 3.0 framework, but the WSDL that it generates is not good enough for a Java client to understand it. I want my Java client to explicitly call the STS and then using the received SAML token make a call to Transaction Services. I tried with Netbeans and Metro WSIT toolkit. I was able to call the Transaction Services if it were implemented using WCF. With WCF Transaction Service the WSDL generated has complete information using which the Java client can figure out how to call to STS and then call the WCF Transaction service. How can my Java client explicitly call the STS and then in turn call the WSE 3.0 transaction services?
Scanner cuts off my String after about 2400 characters : I've got some very basic code likewhile (scan.hasNextLine()){    String temp = scan.nextLine();    System.out.println(temp);}where scan is a Scanner over a file.However, on one particular line, which is about 6k chars long, temp cuts out after something like 2470 characters. There's nothing special about when it cuts out; it's in the middle of the word Australia. If I delete characters from the line, the place where it cuts out changes; e.g. if I delete characters 0-100 in the file then Scanner will get what was previously 100-2570.I've used Scanner for larger strings before. Any idea what could be going wrong?
How to set time zone of a java.util.Date? : I have parsed a java.util.Date from a String but it is setting the local time zone as the time zone of the date object.The time zone is not specified in the String from which Date is parsed.

Cannot remove JAR from cache : I have created a new JAR but I cannot see my changes made.  It seems like its caching the old JAR.When I do a javaws -viewer  I see the date modified column for that JAR as April 7, which is old.  Is there another way to remove java JARS from  cache?I know it works on my local machine with same JARS.  And the date modified field is May 23.  I'm testing on a TEST server where this problem is occurring.Any ideas why?Thank you.

How to use Scanner to accept only valid int as input : I'm trying to make a small program more robust and I need some help with that.Scanner kb = new Scanner(System.in);int num1;int num2 = 0;System.out.print(Enter number 1: );num1 = kb.nextInt();while(num2num1){System.out.print(Enter number 2: );num2 = kb.nextInt();}Number 2 has to be greater than number 1Also I want the program to automatically check and ignore if the user enters a character instead of a number. Because right now when a user enters for example r instead of a number the program just exits.

Memory Size Allocation on GPU - opengl texture loading question : I'm loading pixels from an image which is 32 w by 32 height.  The format I'm loading them in is ARGB via java.  When I bind this to the video card, I can expect that the video card might use somewhere around 32*32*4 bytes, or 4K.  Similarly, 1024 w, 1024 h would be 1024*1024*4 = 4MB.  Is my understanding correct?  Now I understand where all the memory goes!

How can CopyOnWriteArrayList be thread-safe? : I've taken a look into a href=http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/jdk/file/4797cd0713b4/src/share/classes/java/util/concurrent/CopyOnWriteArrayList.java rel=nofollow noreferrerOpenJDK source code of a href=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CopyOnWriteArrayList.html rel=nofollow noreferrerCopyOnWriteArrayList and it seems that all write operations are protected by the same lock and read operations are not protected at all. As I understand, under JMM all accesses to a variable (both read and write) should be protected by lock or reordering effects may occur.For example, set(int, E) method contains these lines (under lock):/* 1 */ int len = elements.length;/* 2 */ Object[] newElements = Arrays.copyOf(elements, len);/* 3 */ newElements[index] = element;/* 4 */ setArray(newElements);The get(int) method, on the other hand, only does return get(getArray(), index);.In my understanding of JMM, this means that get may observe the array in an inconsistent state if statements 1-4 are reordered like 1-2(new)-4-2(copyOf)-3.Do I understand JMM incorrectly or is there any other explanations on why CopyOnWriteArrayList is thread-safe?

WCF client encrypt message to JAVA WS using username_token with message protection client policy : I am trying to create a WCF client APP that is consuming a JAVA WS that uses username_token with message protection client policy.

Is there a 100% Java alternative to ImageIO for reading JPEG files? : We are using Java2D to resize photos uploaded to our website, but we run into an issue (a seemingly old one, cf.: a href=http://forums.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=5425569 rel=nofollow noreferrerhttp://forums.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=5425569) - a few particular JPEGs raise a CMMException when we try to ImageIO.read() an InputStream containing their binary data:java.awt.color.CMMException: Invalid image format at sun.awt.color.CMM.checkStatus(CMM.java:131) at sun.awt.color.ICC_Transform.init(ICC_Transform.java:89) at java.awt.image.ColorConvertOp.filter(ColorConvertOp.java:516) at com.sun.imageio.plugins.jpeg.JPEGImageReader.acceptPixels(JPEGImageReader.java:1114) at com.sun.imageio.plugins.jpeg.JPEGImageReader.readImage(Native Method) at com.sun.imageio.plugins.jpeg.JPEGImageReader.readInternal(JPEGImageReader.java:1082) at com.sun.imageio.plugins.jpeg.JPEGImageReader.read(JPEGImageReader.java:897) at javax.imageio.ImageIO.read(ImageIO.java:1422) at javax.imageio.ImageIO.read(ImageIO.java:1326)    ...(snipped the remainder of the stack trace, which is our ImageIO.read() call, servlet code and such)We narrowed it down to photos taken on specific cameras, and I selected a photo that triggers this error: a href=http://img214.imageshack.us/img214/5121/estacaosp.jpg rel=nofollow noreferrerhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/5121/estacaosp.jpg. We noticed that this only happens with Sun's JVM (on Linux and Mac, just tested it on 1.6.0_20) - a test machine with OpenJDK reads the same photos without a hitch, possibly due to a different implementation of the JPEG reader.Unfortunately, we are unable to switch JVMs in production, nor to use native-dependent solutions such as ImageMagick ( a href=http://www.imagemagick.org/ rel=nofollow noreferrerhttp://www.imagemagick.org/ ).Considering that, my question is: Does a replacement for ImageIOs JPEG reader which can handle photos such as the linked one exist? If not, is there another 100% pure Java photo resizing solution which we can use?Thank you!
Tomcat6 ignores logging.properties partially : I'm using Tomcat 6, and this is my logging.properties:handlers = org.apache.juli.FileHandler, java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level=FINEorg.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationContext.level = OFForg.apache.juli.FileHandler.level = ALLorg.apache.juli.FileHandler.directory = ${catalina.base}/logsorg.apache.juli.FileHandler.prefix = mylog.java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = FINEjava.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter = java.util.logging.SimpleFormatterOn the one hand, Tomcat seems to read this file, as it correctly saves the logfiles with the prefix mylog and prints only messages with log-level FINE and above. On the other hand, it keeps on writing log messages like this:Jun 8, 2010 9:53:30 PM org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationContext logSEVERE: Error writing messagesClientAbortException:  java.net.SocketException: Broken pipeI actually wanted to suppress all log messages from this class, as they flood my logfile, and the error is irrelevant for me. So why is the following line ignored?org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationContext.level = OFFIs there any other way to suppress the log output of this class?
How to specify a JRE range in jnlp file? : We have a java app which uses Java Web Start. The jnlp file is configured with [j2se  version=1.5+]. So if JRE 1.5 and 1.6 are installed, the app is run on 1.6.Now, we have requirement where the app should be restricted to run only within the range - JRE 1.5.0_07 through JRE 1.5.0_17 [j2se version=1.5*] will not work - it will always launch the app with the latest jre from 1.5 family.I can request an exact product version by including the href attribute. [j2se version=1.5.0_14 href=http://java.sun.com/products/autodl/j2se/]But how do I specify a specific range of JREs in the jnlp file so that JWS picks up a JRE from that range only? So if 1.5.0_07, 1.5.0_17 and JRE 6 are installed, it should run the app on 1.5.0_17. Is there a good way to accomplish this?

Connection details  timeouts in a java web service client : I have to implement a webservice client to a given WSDL file.I used the SDK's 'wsimport' tool to create Java classes from the WSDL as well as a class that wrap's the webservice's only method (enhanceAddress(auth, param, address)) into a simple java method. So far, so good. The webservice is functional and returning results correcty. The code looks like this:try {  EnhancedAddressList uniservResponse = getWebservicePort().enhanceAddress(m_auth, m_param, uniservAddress);  //Where the Port^ is the HTTP Soap 1.2 Endpoint}catch (Throwable e) {  throw new AddressValidationException(Error during uniserv webservice request., e);}The Problem now: I need to get Information about the connection and any error that might occur in order to populate various JMX values (such as COUNT_READ_TIMEOUT, COUNT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT, ...)Unfortunately, the method does not officially throw any Exceptions, so in order to get details about a ConnectException, i need to use getCause() on the ClientTransportException that will be thrown.Even worse: I tried to test the read timeout value, but there is none. I changed the service's location in the wsdl file to post the request to a php script that simply waits forever and does not return. Guess what: The web service client does not time out but waits forever as well (I killed the app after 30+ minutes of waiting). That is not an option for my application as i eventually run out of tcp connections if some of them get 'stuck'.The enhanceAddress(auth, param, address) method is not implemented but annotated with javax.jws.* Annotations, meaning that i cannot see/change/inspect the code that is actually executed.Do i have any option but to throw the whole wsimport/javax.jsw-stuff away and implement my own soap client?
Improving field get and set performance with ASM or Javassist : I would like to avoid reflection in an open source project I am developing. Here I have classes like the following.public class PurchaseOrder {   @Property   private Customer customer;   @Property   private String name;}I scan for the @Property annotation to determine what I can set and get from the PurchaseOrder reflectively. There are many such classes all using java.lang.reflect.Field.get() and java.lang.reflect.Field.set().Ideally I would like to generate for each property an invoker like the following.public interface PropertyAccessorS, V {   public void set(S source, V value);   public V get(S source);}Now when I scan the class I can create a static inner class of PurchaseOrder like so.static class customer_Field implements PropertyAccessorPurchaseOrder, Customer {   public void set(PurchaseOrder order, Customer customer) {      order.customer = customer;   }     public Customer get(PurchaseOrder order) {      return order.customer;   }}With these I totally avoid the cost of reflection. I can now set and get from my instances with native performance. Can anyone tell me how I would do this. A code example would be great. I have searched the net for a good example but can find nothing like this. The ASM and Javasist examples are pretty poor also.The key here is that I have an interface that I can pass around. So I can have various implementations, perhaps one with Java Reflection as a default, one with ASM, and one with Javassist?Any help would be greatly appreciated.

JAXB marshals XML differently to OutputStream vs. StringWriter : I apologize if this has been answered, but the search terms I have been using (i.e. JAXB @XmlAttribute condensed or JAXB XML marshal to String different results) aren't coming up with anything.I am using JAXB to un/marshal objects annotated with @XmlElement and @XmlAttribute annotations. I have a formatter class which provides two methods -- one wraps the marshal method and accepts the object to marshal and an OutputStream, the other just accepts the object and returns the XML output as a String. Unfortunately, these methods do not provide the same output for the same objects. When marshaling to a file, simple object fields internally marked with @XmlAttribute are printed as: element value=VALUE/elementwhile when marshaling to a String, they are: element value=VALUE/I would prefer the second format for both cases, but I am curious as to how to control the difference, and would settle for them being the same regardless. I even created one static marshaller that both methods use to eliminate different instance values. The formatting code follows:/** Marker interface for classes which are listed in jaxb.index */public interface Marshalable {}/** Local exception class */public class XMLMarshalException extends BaseException {}/** Class which un/marshals objects to XML */public class XmlFormatter {    private static Marshaller marshaller = null;    private static Unmarshaller unmarshaller = null;    static {        try {            JAXBContext context = JAXBContext.newInstance(path.to.package);            marshaller = context.createMarshaller();            marshaller.setProperty(Marshaller.JAXB_FORMATTED_OUTPUT, true);            marshaller.setProperty(Marshaller.JAXB_ENCODING, UTF-8);            unmarshaller = context.createUnmarshaller();        } catch (JAXBException e) {            throw new RuntimeException(There was a problem creating a JAXBContext object for formatting the object to XML.);        }    }    public void marshal(Marshalable obj, OutputStream os) throws XMLMarshalException {        try {            marshaller.marshal(obj, os);        } catch (JAXBException jaxbe) {            throw new XMLMarshalException(jaxbe);        }    }    public String marshalToString(Marshalable obj) throws XMLMarshalException {        try {            StringWriter sw = new StringWriter();            return marshaller.marshal(obj, sw);        } catch (JAXBException jaxbe) {            throw new XMLMarshalException(jaxbe);        }    }}/** Example data */@XmlType@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)public class Data {    @XmlAttribute(name = value)    private String internalString;}/** Example POJO */@XmlType@XmlRootElement(namespace = project/schema)@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)public class Container implements Marshalable {    @XmlElement(required = false, nillable = true)    private int number;    @XmlElement(required = false, nillable = true)    private String word;    @XmlElement(required = false, nillable = true)    private Data data;}The result of calling marshal(container, new FileOutputStream(output.xml)) and marshalToString(container) are as follows:Output to file  ?xml version=1.0 encoding=UTF-8 standalone=yes?  ns2:container xmlns:ns2=project/schema      number1/number      wordstackoverflow/word      data value=This is internal/data  /ns2:containerandOutput to String  ?xml version=1.0 encoding=UTF-8 standalone=yes?  ns2:container xmlns:ns2=project/schema      number1/number      wordstackoverflow/word      data value=This is internal/  /ns2:container

Where does java.util.logging.Logger store their log : This might be a stupid question but I am a bit lost with java Logger private static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(order.web.OrderManager);logger.info(Removed order  + id + .);Where do I see the log? Also this quote from java.util.logging.Logger library: blockquote  On each logging call the Logger initially performs a cheap check of the request level (e.g. SEVERE or FINE) against the effective log level of the logger. If the request level is lower than the log level, the logging call returns immediately.  After passing this initial (cheap) test, the Logger will allocate a LogRecord to describe the logging message. It will then call a Filter (if present) to do a more detailed check on whether the record should be published. If that passes it will then publish the LogRecord to its output Handlers.`/blockquoteDoes this mean that if I have 3 request level log:logger.log(Level.FINE, Something);logger.log(Level.WARNING, Something);logger.log(Level.SEVERE, Something);And my log level is SEVERE, I can see all three logs, and if my log level is WARNING, then I can't see SEVERE log, is that correct? And how do I set the log level?

Java service wrapper and additional application command line parameters : I'm currently using a href=http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/doc/english/download.jsp rel=nofollow noreferrerjava service wrapper to wrap a java application that I've developed.  I'm needing to ability to pass in additional command line parameters to my application through the java service wrapper.Pretend my app is called myapp and I've setup java service wrapper so that the script I run to start is called myapp.  I'd like to be able to do something like this:./myapp start Parameter1 parameter2and have those additional parameters get passed into my application.  Any ideas how to do this? I'm finding that googling and looking at the documentation is only pulling up how to use command line arguments to setup java service wrapper. I've had difficulty finding anything about passing command line arguments to your application except for having them hard coded in your wrapper.conf file.Right now I feel like my option is to take the additional command line parameters, set them to environment variables and have those hard coded in the wrapper.conf. I'd prefer not to go down that road though and am hoping I've overlooked something.
Is there known issues for JWS applications on Windows 7? : I've got a JWS application which works perfectly on Windows XP but fails to start on Windows 7. The problem is that Java is not able to find the native library which is embeded in a JAR bundle:UnsatisfiedLinkError: no xxxxxx.dll in java.library.pathThe problem is not in the DLL (missing dependency for example) because if I put it in C:\windows\system32\, the JWS application works.So I want to know if there are some known issues which can explain that Java is not able to load/find a well-served native library on Windows 7?
Compatibility between Scala closures and Java 8 closures : After reading some OpenJDK mailinglist entries, it seems that the Oracle developers are currently further removing things from the closure proposal, because earlier design mistakes in the Java language complicate the introduction of the Java closures.Considering that Scala closures are much more powerful than the closures planned for Java 8, I wonder if it will be possible to e. g. call a Java method taking a closure from Scala, defining a closure in Java and giving it to a Scala function etc.?So will Java closures be represented like their Scala counterparts in bytecode or differently?Will it be possible to close the gap of functionality between Java/Scala closures?

MPXJ in .NET converting java Date to .NET DateTime : I'm using the MPXJ library in .NET for parsing MS Project (MPP) files, and it's working great.  The one issue I'm having is trying to translate the task Start and Finish date into .NET DateTime to use with my data models.I am going through all the tasks and calling task.getFinish() and task.getStart() that both return javva.util.Date objects.When I use task.getFinish().getYear(), task.getFinish().getMonth(), etc. to build up a new DateTime object it warns me that they are obsolete.What is the best way to get the start and finish dates from MPXJ into a .NET DateTime object?Thanks.
Validating input using java.util.Scanner : I'm taking user input from System.in using a java.util.Scanner. I need to validate the input for things like:It must be a non-negative numberIt must be an alphabetical letter... etcWhat's the best way to do this?
bridge methods explaination : If I do an override of a clone method the compiler create a bridge method toguarantee a correct polymorphism (THIS IS THE CLASS DECOMPILED)class Point{    Point()    {    }    protected Point clone()        throws CloneNotSupportedException    {        return this; // not good only for example!!!    }    protected volatile Object clone()        throws CloneNotSupportedException    {        return clone();    }}so when is invoked the clone method the bridge method is invoked and inside it is invoked the correct clone method. But my question is when into the bridge method is called return clone() how do the VM to say that it must invoke Point clone() and not itself again???
Can you jump a scanner to a location in file or scan backwards? : I have a very large text file and I need to gather data from somewhere near the end.  Maybe Scanner isn't the best way to do this but it would be very wasteful to start at the top and grab 6000 lines before getting to the part of the file I am interested in.  Is there a way to either tell Scanner to jump to say 7/8ths down the document or start from the bottom and scan upwards grabbing line by line?Thanks
Non class files with Java Web Start : How do you distribute other files needed by your application that aren't in a jar file?  For example, the application at a href=http://www.javabeginner.com/java-swing/java-swing-shuffle-game rel=nofollow noreferrerhttp://www.javabeginner.com/java-swing/java-swing-shuffle-game .  The download contains Shuffle.jar, Shuffle.bat, Score.dat, and an images folder with 3 images in it.  I can see possibly putting the images directly in Shuffle.jar, but you wouldn't want to put Score.dat in the jar file because it changes.  Is there somewhere you could identify this type of file in the jnlp?  
Does a java agent run in a separate thread? : I feel that this is something I should know, but does a java agent (specified with -javaagent) run in a separate thread? I've read that a href=http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t19309.html rel=nofollow noreferrera Java agent is a pluggable library that runs embedded in a JVM and intercepts the classloading process, but I want to make sure: does it really intercept them (which sounds like it's running in another thread and monitoring class loads) or is it notified by the JVM (the JVM invokes it to resolve the class load; there isn't a separate thread for it)?Again, I get the feeling that I should be able to figure it out, but be nice to me, I'm working too hard and my brain is kinda fried :PThanks!

JDK 6: Is there a way to run a new java process that executes the main method of a specified class : I'm trying to develop an application that just before quit has to run a new daemon process to execute the main method of a class.I require that after the main application quits the daemon process must still be in execution.It is a Java Stored Procedure running on Oracle DB so I can't use Runtime.exec because I can't locate the java class from the Operating System Shell because it's defined in database structures instead of file system files.In particular the desired behavior should be that during a remote database session I should be able tocall the first java method that runs the daemon process and quits leaving the daemon process in execution stateand then (having the daemon process up and the session control, because the last call terminated) consequentially call a method that communicates with the daemon process (that finally quits at the end of the communication)Is this possible?ThanksUpdateMy exact need is to create and load (reaching the best performances) a big text file into the database supposing that the host doesn't have file transfer services from a Java JDK6 client application connecting to Oracle 11gR1 DB using JDBC-11G oci driver.I already developed a working solution by calling a procedure that stores into a file the LOB(large database object) given as input, but such a method uses too many intermediate structures that I want to avoid.So I thought about creating a ServerSocket on the DB with a first call and later connect to it and establish the data transfer with a direct and fast communication. The problem I encountered comes out because the java procedure that creates the ServerSocket can't quit and leave an executing Thread/Process listening on that Socket and the client, to be sure that the ServerSocket has been created, can't run a separate Thread to handle the rest of the job.Hope to be clear

Java WebStart JNLP: Run Different Code in First Run : We are using WebStart JNLP file to create a shortcut on our users` desktop.The problem is that we would like the code in our jar file to be launched only when the user press the desktop shortcut.However, Java WebStart executes the jar also on the first launch (when we set the desktop icon).Is there any way we can set the icon without running the jar, but to launch the jar when the user press the desktop icon?
Restrict string input from user to alphabetic and numerical values : Basically, my situation requires me to check to see if the String that is defined by user input from the keyboard is only alphabetical characters in one case and only digits in another case.

Any ideas how I could create a network usage meter for Java SE? : I need to meter the number of bytes being used by a java application from within java (i.e. I don't have any special access to the JVM other then not having a security manager to deal with) but I need all the bytes sent/received including protocol headers and the like. Anyone have good ideas on how to do this?The obvious move is to create a new URLConnectionHandler and insert metering into the IO streams. This, however, does not provide me with the header sizes of HTTP/HTTPS messages sent to/from a Java application.

Effective Java item 1 applicability with TDD and dependency injection : I have been reading Effective Java and I have some concerns regarding the first Item use static factory method instead of constructor in relation to TDD and dependency injection. The item says that you should avoid having public/protected/default constructor and expose it using static factory. I agree with all the advantages related to using static factories like factories can have name, you can return subtype, you can reduce verbosity etc. But, I think in disadvantages Joshua missed TDD because having static factories in your code will lead to tight coupling and you can't mock the class using it. We will not be able to mock the class which will be having static factories. So, it hampers test driven development.Second point, I think he missed that in todays enterprise development most of the applications use one or another dependency injection container. So, when we can inject dependencies using DI so why should I use it.Please explain how it applies to today's Java enterprise development which includes DI and TDD.
Unable to do fast I/O of dynamically generated images on a IP camera : I have a image file stored at a remote server (i.e a href=http://example.com/images).The rel=nofollow noreferrerhttp://example.com/images).The images in this folder are getting updated at the rate of 1 image per 100 milliseconds Think of ip cams that transmit MJPEG images .I am using apache HTTP client api to connect to my remote server .I am getting a stream of the contentHttpClient httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient();    HttpGet httpget = new HttpGet(http://example.com/images/screenshot.jpg);    HttpResponse response = httpClient.execute(httpget);    HttpEntity entity = response.getEntity();    if (entity != null) {    InputStream instream = entity.getContent();I am wrapping up the input stream in BufferedInputStream for faster I/O .But since the images are getting generated at very fast rate and they are on an average 250kb in size.I would like to use the NIO features like FileChannel as well as MemoryMappedBuffers to improve the I/O performance as well access generated image files on remote server in non blocking mode.But whatever samples I have seen talk about creating FileInputStream / RandomAccessFiles which take File Object as parameter.I am getting the InputStream as response from remote server which I am unable to convert to FileInputStream to get FileChannel.I would like to know if there is any implementation in apache http client api that gives fileChannels.Or should i explore sockets to get the channel access.I have also exlored javax.imageIO , but not sure if it will meet my requirement of faster I/O

How does the java-service-wrapper decide whether to use the 32 or 64 bit VM? : We're using a vendor licensed copy of the a href=http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/doc/english/download.jsp rel=nofollow noreferrerTanuki Java Service Wrapper to start their platform. It ships with wrappers for every O/S flavour and architecture and the recommended profile is a 64 bit VM with a 3 gig heap.We're using 64 bit Redhat, but I've been unable to find a wrapper configuration option which forces the wrapper.sh script to use the wrapper-linux-x86-64 binary. The only way I have been able to get the wrapper to start in 64 bit mode is by deleting the wrapper-linux-x86-32 binary.Is there a way to force the wrapper into 64 bit mode? Is it simply trying to choose the fastest appropriate VM setting and choosing 32 bit mode when it can because our heap is less than 4 gig?I'd like to learn more about how the java-service-wrapper makes the 32/64 bit decision but have been unable to find anything online.
Java stored procedures as Java / .Net interop : I'm looking for a way to access a Java API from both a Java console application and an ASP.Net application.In short my Java API exposes a series of methods for dealing with invoices. All of these methods are essentially commands e.g.GenerateAllInvociesGenerateInvoiceNumberPrintAllInvoicesPrintInvoiceNumberAll methods will interact with the database. I had believed Web Services was going to be my means for interop. But I have since been made aware of Java Stored Procedures in Oracle.I believe this means I could essentially treat my stored procs as an API and have the stored procs themselves call appropriate Java to write invoices to disk and to print the invoices etc. However this feels slightly odd.Has anyone out there every used Java stored procedures to provides interop between calling Java and .Net applications before? Any suggestions? Is this a really bad idea?Thanks.

Any way to have Java Web Start automatically install shortcuts? : We're deploying a Web Start app that I and the other developers know how to install the shortcuts for (Control Panel - Java on Windows, /Applications/Utilities/Java Preferences on OS X), but we have no reason to believe that end users know how to do this (or even know that it can be done).Is there a way to either install the shortcuts automatically on first run, or (much preferably) ask the user if they'd like to install the shortcuts?  I've been looking all over but the Sun/Oracle docs all say to go through the Java cache viewer, which I find completely ridiculous to ask of end users.

Configuring permissions for JNLP: : I'm trying to run a webstart demo, which ran on my friend's Windows machine, but throws an access error on my Ubuntu Linux box.  javaws http://common.l2fprod.com/jnlp/demo.jnlpAnd I get the following error on my Linux box:java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.util.PropertyPermission javawebstart.version read)I assume this is a configuration issue on my Ubuntu machine.  What needs to be changed to allow access to the webstart version?

Java web start doesn't launch : On my Windows 7 x64 machine, I'm having problems launching my remotely deployed Web Start app (the Web Start app launches correctly on another PC as expected).  In IE or FF, I click on the web start launch link, the JNLP is downloaded, it seems to get executed and nothing happens.  I see javaws.exe processes running.  I don't see a java.exe running.  I don't know if it's related but I also can't get the java console to run.  In the Control Panel Java applet settings, I have have enabled Show console and place Java icon in the system tray.  I don't see the Java icon in the system tray either.I'm running Java 1.6.0_21 (32 bit).  I'm able to run Netbeans so the it appears as if Java is installed correctly on my machine.  Why isn't web start working?
Thread safe Hash Map? : I am writing an application which will return a HashMap to user. User will get reference to this MAP.On the backend, I will be running some threads which will update the Map.What I have done so far?I have made all the backend threads so share a common channel to update the MAP. So at backend I am sure that concurrent write operation will not be an issue.Issues I am havingIf user tries to update the MAP and simultaneously MAP is being updated at backend -- Concurrent write operation problem.If use tries to read something from MAP and simultaneously MAP is being updated at backend -- concurrent READ and WRITE Operation problem.Untill now I have not face any such issue, but i m afraid that i may face in future. Please give sugesstions.I am using ConcurrentHashMapString, String.

How to give name to a callable Thread? : I am executing a Callable Object using ExecutorService thread pool. I want to give a name to this thread.To be more specific, in older version I did this -Thread thread = new Thread(runnable Task);thread.setName(My Thread Name);I use thread name in log4j logging, this helps a lot while troubleshooting. Now I am migrating my code from Java 1.4 to Java 1.6. I have written this(Given below)- but I dont know how to give name to this thread.private final ExecutorService executorPool = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();FutureString result = executorPool.submit(callable Task);Please give me some idea to give name to this thread?
Scanner in Java not working : I'm trying to write a very simple number guessing game (code is below). After 1 round is finished, the user is supposed to be able to decide whether he/she wants to play another round or not.

android r.java will not update : I googled a lot to find various hints what could cause this problem. Many of them on this forum, but nothing works.I installed the sdk from scratch on 3 different machines (xp, macos snow leopard, leopard) and always the same problem, that even the sample code in the android sdk doesn't compile.After hours of looking through the xml files I recognized, that when I remove ' from strings the sample code of the sdk will compile.So does a new project, as long there is no change needed in the R.java file.As soon as I try to add a button with findViewByID, I get the error that the field R.id cannot be resolved. No other changes were done to the project.As mentioned before I tried various things, including:clean project, rebuildrestart eclipseupdate sdk (even tough I installed the new sdk)no uppercase letters...Install sdk, latest eclipse classic on a clean machineI don't think it's an issue of the code itself, because even the sample code provided by the sdk doesn't compile without removing ' from the xml.Please somebody has some hints and ideas where to look next please?
Accessing XML payload of Metro 2.0 Request/Response Web Service : I am developing a web service, using Metro 2.0 and Tomcat 6, and I have a requirement to be able to log the XML payload of the request and response of a web method for development/support reasons.  The payload would only be logged when in debug mode.The Web Service uses a servlet implementation (com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.servlet.WSServlet  and .WSServletContextListener classes), if that affects the answer.Is this even possible?Thanks in advance,Andy
