.


The system is implemented in , a fully distributed database on a separate cluster and a third cluster with HSMs keeping the different CA keys.
EJBCA supports many common PKI Architectures. An example architecture is illustrated below.

EJBCA supports running unlimited number of CAs and levels of CAs in a single installation. Build a complete infrastructure, or several, within one instance of EJBCA.
For certificate validation your have the choice of using X.509 ).
You can use all common, and some uncommon algorithms in your PKI. .
EJBCA support both X.509v3 certificates and Card Verifiable certificates (CVC BSI TR-03110). Certificates are compliant with all standards such as  9303, EAC 2.10 and ISO 18013 Amendment 2 eDL.
Using the standard  API you can use most PKCS#11 compliant HSMs to protect the CAs, and OCSP Responders, private keys.
EJBCA was designed with integration in mind. Most standard protocols are supported, , as well as web services. Using integration APIs it is possible to integrate EJBCA as a certificate factory, not exposing it's native user interfaces.
You can build a PKI with capacity of issuing billions of certificates at a rate of several hundreds per second.
