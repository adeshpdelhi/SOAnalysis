GeoGebra continues to expand its efforts to deliver the best possible dynamic mathematics software and services to students and teachers worldwide, with a community of users that extends to all but a few countries. GeoGebra includes both a commercial and not-for-profit entity, working closely together from the head office in Linz, Austria to continue to expand the software and cloud services available to its user community of students, teachers, and growing network of government partners.


GeoGebra is an interactive mathematics software program for learning and teaching mathematics and science from primary school up to university level. Constructions can be made with points, vectors, segments, lines, polygons, conic sections, inequalities, implicit polynomials and functions. All of them can be changed dynamically afterwards. Elements can be entered and modified directly via mouse and touch, or through the Input Bar. GeoGebra has the ability to use variables for numbers, vectors and points, find derivatives and integrals of functions and has a full complement of commands like Root or Extremum. Teachers and students can use GeoGebra to make conjectures and to understand how to prove geometric theorems.
Its main features are:
Dynamic GeoGebra applets can be directly uploaded to the GeoGebra Materials platform, the official cloud service and repository of GeoGebra related and interactive learning and teaching resources. GeoGebra Materials was initially launched under the name GeoGebraTube in June 2011 and renamed in 2016. With recent improvement and extended functionality the service now hosts more than 1 million resources (April 2016), 400,000+ of which are shared publicly as searchable materials - such as interactive worksheets, simulations, games, and e-books created using the GeoGebraBook feature.
GeoGebra materials can be also exported in several formats, including as static images or as  export options.

The International GeoGebra Institute (IGI) is the not-for-profit entity of The GeoGebra Group, coordinating deployment and research efforts across a global network of user groups at universities and non-profit organizations. IGI joins teachers, students, software developers and researchers to support, develop, translate and organise the GeoGebra related tasks and projects. The local user groups support students and teachers in their region. As part of the International GeoGebra Institute network they share free educational materials via the GeoGebra Materials platform, organize workshops, and work on projects related to GeoGebra. The International GeoGebra Institute may certify local GeoGebra users, experts, and trainers according to certain guidelines.
