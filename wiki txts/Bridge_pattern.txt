When a class varies often, the features of . The bridge pattern can also be thought of as two layers of abstraction.
When there is only one fixed implementation, this pattern is known as the  world.
The , e.g. in the Java code below.
: The implementation can be decoupled even more by deferring the presence of the implementation to the point where the abstraction is utilized.



Bridge pattern compose objects in tree structure. It decouples abstraction from implementation. Here abstraction represents the client from which the objects will be called. An example to implement in C# is given below
As you can see, the Bridge classes are the Implementation that uses the same interface-oriented architecture to create objects. On the other hand, the abstraction takes an object of the implementation phase and runs its method. Thus, it makes completely decoupled from one another.
Output
The following  (SE 6) program illustrates a 'shape'.
It will output:
