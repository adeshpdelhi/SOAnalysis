Green threads refers to the name of the Java thread library. The Green Team is the name of the team at Sun Microsystems that designed the Java thread library.
On a  Green threads can be started much faster on some VMs. On uniprocessor computers, however, the most efficient model has not yet been clearly determined.
Benchmarks on computers running the (long outdated) 
When a green thread executes a blocking system call, not only is that thread blocked, but all of the threads within the process are blocked.
There are also mechanisms which allow use of native threads and reduce the overhead of thread activation and synchronization:

An exception to this is the  to an absolute minimum and to support the migration of its isolates.
Kilim produced by the Java compiler (Quasar also supports Kotlin and Clojure).
There are some other  that implement equivalents of green threads instead of native threads. Examples:
The 
In the case of GHC Haskell, a context switch occurs at the first allocation after a configurable timeout. GHC threads are also potentially run on one or more OS threads during their lifetime (there is a many-to-many relationship between GHC threads and OS threads), allowing for parallelism on 
Occam is unusual in this list because its original implementation was tied to the , and hence no virtual machine was necessary. Later ports to other processors have introduced a virtual machine modeled on the design of the Transputer, an effective choice because of the low overheads involved.
Most Smalltalk virtual machines do not count evaluation steps; however, the VM can still preempt the executing thread on external signals (such as expiring timers, or I/O becoming available). Usually :
Other implementations, e.g. QKS Smalltalk, are always time-sharing. Unlike most green thread implementations, QKS Smalltalk also has support for preventing .
