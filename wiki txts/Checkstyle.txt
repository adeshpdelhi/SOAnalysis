The  adopted by a software development project can help to comply with good programming practices which improve the code quality, readability, re-usability, and reduce the cost of development. The performed checks mainly limit themselves to the presentation and don't analyze content, and do not confirm the correctness or completeness of the program. In practice, it can be tedious to comply with all the style constraints, some of which could possibly harm the programming stages' dynamic; so, it may be useful to determine which level of check is needed for a certain type of program.
 defines a set of available modules, each of which provides rules checking with a configurable level of strictness (mandatory, optional...). Each rule can raise notifications, warnings, and errors. For example, checkstyle can examine:
 or other tools.
A Checkstyle plug-in can provide new functionalities, like:
Thus, the developer can directly access the code parts highlighted by Checkstyle.
