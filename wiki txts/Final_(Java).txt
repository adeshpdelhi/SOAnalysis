Example:
Any attempt to reassign  will result in a compile error. In fact, even if the constructor doesn't set a final variable, attempting to set it outside the constructor will result in a compilation error.
To illustrate that finality doesn't guarantee immutability: suppose we replace the three position variables with a single one:
where  cannot be assigned to, but the three properties can, unless they are final themselves.
Like full s.
Though it appears to violate the  principle, the following is a legal statement:
Since the obj variable goes out of scope with each iteration of the loop, it is actually redeclared each iteration, allowing the same token (i.e. 
When an anonymous  has been removed, the original variable is gone but the inner class's private copy persists in the class's own memory.

Further, because C and C++ expose pointers and references directly, there is a distinction between whether the pointer itself is constant, and whether the data pointed to by the pointer is constant. Applying .
Due to casting, C++  objects with final members.
