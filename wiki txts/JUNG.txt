.
JUNG's architecture is designed to support a variety of representations of entities and their relations, such as , random graph generation, statistical analysis, and calculation of network distances, flows, and importance measures.
JUNG provides a visualization framework that makes it easy to construct tools for the interactive exploration of network data. Users can use one of the layout algorithms provided, or use the framework to create their own custom layouts. In addition, filtering mechanisms are provided which allow users to focus their attention, or their algorithms, on specific portions of the graph.
