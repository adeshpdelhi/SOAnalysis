Using the Cajo Project, ordinary unmodified Java objects, can be remote using a single line of code:
These can then be used by remote machines either statically, or dynamically.
. For example:
The remote object implements this interface, and possibly others, then remotes the object as shown previously.
 The user of a remote object can create a reference to this object, which actually implements the shared interface, as follows:
A remote machine may now invoke methods on the remote object, with the exact Java syntax and semantics, as if it were local.
 A machine dynamically uses a remote object reference as follows:
Object object = Remote.getItem("//someHost:1198/someName");
String someMethod = "someMethod";
Object someArgs = new Object[...] { someArgs, ... };
This snippet invokes a method on a remote object, providing the arguments, 
The cajo framework can allow a machine to remote its object reference using  address of the host machine.
The Cajo Project is also used to remote graphical user interfaces. objects.
