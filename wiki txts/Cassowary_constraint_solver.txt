				 toolkit that efficiently solves systems of linear equalities and inequalities. Constraints may be either requirements or preferences. Client code specifies the constraints to be maintained, and the solver updates the constrained variables to have values that satisfy the constraints.
Cassowary was developed by Greg Badros,  in a more flexible manner. Cassowary is used to solve these constraints and calculate the final layout.
, and STk.
Other people have ported the solver to  (Cassowary.net).
