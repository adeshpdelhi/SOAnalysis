JBI is built on a  (MEPs), taken from WSDL 2.0:
To handle functionality that deals with installation, deployment, monitoring and lifecycle concerns amongst BCs and SEs,  (JMX) is used. JBI defines standardized packaging for BCs and SEs, allowing components to be portable to any JBI implementation without modification.
JBI defines standard packaging for composite applications: applications that are composed of service consumers and providers. Individual service units are deployable to components; groups of service units are gathered together into a service assembly. The service assembly includes metadata for "wiring" the service units together (associating service providers and consumers), as well as wiring service units to external services. This provides a simple mechanism for performing composite application assembly using services.
