Almost all collections in Java are derived from the  Note that the angled brackets &lt; &gt; can hold a type argument that specifies which type the collection holds.
Lists are implemented in the JCF via the  interface. It defines a list as essentially a more flexible version of an array. Elements have a specific order, and duplicate elements are allowed. Elements can be placed in a specific position. They can also be searched for within the list. Two examples for concrete classes that implement List are:
Stacks are created using  with five operations that allow a vector to be treated as a stack. The usual push and pop operations are provided, as well as a method to peek at the top item on the stack, a method to test for whether the stack is empty, and a method to search the stack for an item and discover how far it is from the top. When a stack is first created, it contains no items.
