An opposite but analogous case is the  platform. Java EE application servers provide system services in a well-defined, open, industry standard. The application developers develop programs according to the Java EE specification and not according to the application server. A Java EE application developed according to Java EE standard can be deployed in any Java EE application server making it vendor independent.
This article compares the features and functionality of application servers, grouped by the hosting environment that is offered by that particular application server.
